The default `grsecurity-build-compile command` doesn't include it. All you do is optionally copy the Ubuntu kernel package control files into some subdirs of ubuntu-package (plus one for headers-postinst). Is this functionality even used if you don't utilize  `--overlay-dir`? Is `ubuntu-package` a valid \"overlay directory\" if ubuntu-xenial is the kernels source itself?\r\n Please enlighten me the point of this or how it fits in, if at all. Also, is there a difference or reason why `deb-pkg` was chosen over `deb-kpkg`?\r\n\r\nIf the overlay dir functionality is going to stay, it should start including xenial support soon. I just tried it myself with success and can submit a patch.  As ya'll know, I make use of pieces of your stuff in my other environments and I try to give back here and there.
