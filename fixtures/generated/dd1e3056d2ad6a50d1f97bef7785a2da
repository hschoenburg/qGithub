all!\r\n\r\nI am trying to create my own scene with UE4 (4.12, compiled for Linux following the instructions) and UnrealCV (0.3) rather than just using the RealisticRendering cooked binary. I am just creating a blank project in which UE4 inserts a couple of chairs, a table, a statue, and two floor tiles.\r\n\r\nI just choose the correct GameMode Override and run the scene. Then when sending the command to retrieve the list of objects (more specifically):\r\n\r\n```\r\nobject_list_ = client.request('vget /objects').split(' ')\r\nprint(\"There are \" + str(len(object_list_)) + \" objects in this scene...\")\r\nprint(object_list_)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just get a list with a single 'ok' element like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThere are 1 objects in this scene...\r\n['ok']\r\n```\r\nThe scene contains various static meshes so I don't know what could be causing this problem. That makes impossible to obtain object segmentation masks. I am able to get good RGB images, depth maps, and normal information.\r\n\r\nI tried to find the RealisticRendering UE4 project to see if objects must be arranged in any special way but I was not able to find anything else than already compiled binaries.\r\n\r\nIf any of you knows what could be going on, I would be really grateful.

correct me if I'm wrong. In general, glm seems to adhere to the XYZ convention for Euler angles, meaning you'd left-multiply a column vector to get the rotated vector, like so: `[u_n, v_n, w_n]' = X*Y*Z*[u, v, w]'`. But in general it doesn't say very often in the documentation which convention exactly glm follows. Sometimes one can guess from the function name.\r\n\r\nBut take for example `glm::eulerAngles(glm::quat q)`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfloat pitch = glm::radians(10.0f); // x axis\r\nfloat yaw = glm::radians(30.0f); // y axis\r\nfloat roll = glm::radians(20.0f); // z axis\r\nauto xyz_mat = eulerAngleXYZ(pitch, yaw, roll);\r\nquat q(xyz_mat);\t\r\nauto angles = glm::eulerAngles(q); // Quat to angles. pitch yaw roll.\r\nfloat t1_x, t2_y, t3_z;\r\nglm::extractEulerAngleXYZ(xyz_mat, t1_x, t2_y, t3_z);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe angles in `angles` are very different from the original angles. `glm::extractEulerAngleXYZ` however works correctly and returns the same angles. But in what convention are the angles that `glm::eulerAngles(q)` returns? I can't find it in the documentation. Or maybe I'm having a misconception about the topic at hand?\r\n\r\nApart from that, isn't the documentation ambiguous - if you only say it follows the convention `X*Y*Z`, it would be either `row_vec*X*Y*Z` or `X*Y*Z*col-vec`, which would result in a completely different rotation?\r\n\r\nAdditionally I have another small question: Is the XYZ (and YXZ) kind of the standard in OpenGL? I have seen the convention ZXY (which would be `R*P*Y` (roll-pitch-yaw)) applied much more - in fact I think I even remember hearing that RPY is some kind of MPEG or ISO standard convention. In any case I think it would be nice to have a function `eulerAngleZXY` [here](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/api/a00021.html).\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/g-truc/glm/issues/comments/351223878","html_url":"https://github.com/g-truc/glm/issues/569#issuecomment-351223878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/g-truc/glm/issues/569","id":351223878,"user":{"login":"doublerebel","id":212827,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/212827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel","html_url":"https://github.com/doublerebel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-12T23:01:01Z","updated_at":"2017-12-12T23:01:01Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"As [mentioned on stackoverflow][0], Mike Day's method\r\n> is also now implemented in glm, as of version 0.9.7.0, 02/08/2015\r\n\r\nin commit jzrake/glm@d3313421 .  We can see that this is the same method as @CuriousRubick .  Mike Day's method has less edge cases than Shoemake's, I do not expect that it is \"broken\".\r\n\r\nI arrived here looking for an open-source implementation of Day's method, as OpenCV [is still using Shoemake's][1].  OpenEXR [has a separate variant][2] that is functionally the same but appears to predate Day's, the `blame` goes back to at least 2006.  The OpenEXR implementation [claims][3] to be based on [Shoemake's GemsIV][3] but clearly has been updated to use rotation instead of testing for minimal value.\r\n\r\nBoth OpenEXR and Shoemake's code provide good examples of supporting varied axis ordering.  Also, I think OpenEXR's header commentary is a good example of documenting the axis ordering.\r\n\r\nThanks all for your work and discussion which lead me to these implementations.\r\n\r\n[0]: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/50963/how-to-extract-euler-angles-from-transformation-matrix/112271#112271\r\n[1]: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/05b15943d6a42c99e5f921b7dbaa8323f3c042c6/apps/interactive-calibration/rotationConverters.cpp#L15\r\n[2]: https://github.com/openexr/openexr/blob/891437f74805f6c8ebc897932091cbe0bb7e1163/IlmBase/Imath/ImathEuler.h#L515\r\n[3]: https://github.com/openexr/openexr/blob/891437f74805f6c8ebc897932091cbe0bb7e1163/IlmBase/Imath/ImathEuler.h#L47\r\n[4]: https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gemsiv/euler_angle/EulerAngles.c"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-12-12T23:01:02Z","org":{"id":2284687,"login":"g-truc","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/g-truc","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2284687?"}},{"id":"6954363199","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":212827,"login":"doublerebel","display_login":"doublerebel","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doublerebel","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212827?"},"repo":{"id":67727697,"name":"unrealcv/unrealcv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/100","id":279826159,"number":100,"title":"wrong rgb colorw","user":{"login":"edgarriba","id":5157099,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5157099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarriba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarriba/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-12-06T16:49:30Z","updated_at":"2017-12-07T01:00:50Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi, I render a view using the following command `vget /camera/0/lit png` throw the python interface.
