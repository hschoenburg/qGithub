A real application coming out of a CI/CD pipeline most likely doesn't need it. If I do need a mechanism to trigger a lambda directly, I can roll my own very easily without the baggage of a test button eating up a resource for every single lambda.\r\n\r\n- At the very least, being able to disable the test permission declaratively in the template would be useful, and should be easy to implement. If I have explicit control of that then its my decision whether to use it or not.\r\n- Nested stack support would need more thought, but would help greatly. At a minimum, I would love to see the api gateway separated out from the logical grouping of functions. For example, if I have CRUD API, and I want 4 lambdas for it, then having a function group and APIG in the master , and the actual lambdas in the child would be very useful.\r\n\r\nWe are having to club multiple functions together in one lambda, and then do a routing from inside the lambda to work around this. So , now I need to manage my api definitions in the cloudformation, swagger AND code.

playing around with SAM for about 6 months and I really love it. I have my proof of concept done and realized there are some day 1 requirements for my projects missing.\r\n\r\n1. CORS (easy to work around. Already implemented)\r\n2. Authorizers with Cognito (Can implement custom authorization inside the code)\r\n3. Custom Domains (can work around for a few months)\r\n4. Cache TTL (can implement a caching service or live without for a few months)\r\n5. API Key (can use cloud formation with some code workaround)\r\n\r\nThese are all covered in #248 but I am between a rock and a hard place. My go live date is July and I have to make a decision. Do I wait for the items in #248 and hope that they make it in or do I just assume these features won't make it in time. This will force me to (painfully) write hacks in my code to get everything to work.\r\n\r\nI tried to get a sense of timeline from @jfuss comment on Jan 8 when he said \"All of these (in the issue) are being prioritize with high priority in the team and are going to be the first set of things we will address this year.\"\r\n\r\nCan you please provide either an ETA or tell us your release plan? Will it be one large release or will it be minor releases?

Because I want to upload the training logs and some other training intermediate data to the same folder. Sounds like sagemaker.Session should have property/method to support it but I didn't find it yet.\r\n\r\nOr is there a way to pass in job name as parameter to train script? Actually, the job name is available when create training job.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/scikit_bring_your_own/scikit_bring_your_own.ipynb"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/issues/comments/369375351","html_url":"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/issues/199#issuecomment-369375351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/issues/199","id":369375351,"user":{"login":"ThisIsRick","id":8013720,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8013720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick","html_url":"https://github.com/ThisIsRick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThisIsRick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T20:40:46Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T20:40:46Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Work around by put the training job name in hyperparameter."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T20:40:46Z","org":{"id":3299148,"login":"awslabs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/awslabs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3299148?"}},{"id":"7312341744","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":3926469,"login":"JonathanHenson","display_login":"JonathanHenson","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JonathanHenson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3926469?"},"repo":{"id":122117292,"name":"awslabs/aws-c-event-stream","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/awslabs/aws-c-event-stream"},"payload":{"push_id":2366575004,"size":1,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/event-stream-impl","head":"08b2125957daecc4a23c9cb2a988d6d4139d3327","before":"1b58ba9f0b573f47b4cfb263f0b36aac5d113ff1","commits":[{"sha":"08b2125957daecc4a23c9cb2a988d6d4139d3327","author":{"email":"henso@amazon.com","name":"Jonathan M.

the title suggests the AWSCognitioIdentityUser when attempting to create a session using the SDK doesn't actually authenticate the user immediately after the continueBlock even though it came back as a success.\r\n\r\nAfter the continueBlock comes back with a success i move the user to the next viewController and attempt to call a lambda function using the new assigned identity ID, but unfortunately the ID is rejected by my lambda function because the identity ID isn't the ID of the user that just logged in and thus the identity has a value of unauthenticated. \r\n\r\nTo be more specific i am using the explicit log in [[getSession username: password: ] continueWithBlock].\r\n\r\nIf i was to restart the app, the users session is found immediately and when i attempt to make the

suggestions here:\r\n\r\n1.  Before changing the logged in user, you should also call [clearCredentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSiOSSDK/latest/Classes/AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider.html#//api/name/clearCredentials) on your credentials provider.  Credentials are good for an hour, and the credentials provider will continue to use the ones it has unless you tell it to drop them.\r\n2. You don't need to call getIdentityId prior to calling your lambda, if you've associated your lambda client with your credentials provider, it will lazily call getIdentityId/getCredentials as necessary.\r\n3. It is unclear what credentials provider you have associated with your lambda client.  Normally you have a single credentials provider that your configure in your AppDelegate and is the credentials provider for all clients.  Creating multiple credentials providers can have unpredictable results if you are expecting them to play nicely with each other.  I would recommend setting up your user pool and credentials provider in the app delegate as the defaults  "}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T20:30:44Z","org":{"id":3299148,"login":"awslabs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/awslabs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3299148?"}}]
