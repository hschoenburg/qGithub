browsers as the unit tests\r\n`yarn wdio --local` - runs against chrome locally\r\n\r\nTests are written in the same way as the unit tests, but they have a global `browser` object to perform actions on, and pull info from, the page.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the need for `bin/e2e.js` and `bin/server.js` but I haven't removed them yet.","created_at":"2018-02-06T13:54:39Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T15:05:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f702cb0c5661298a41c52d4a12283d51e74f36c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treasure-data/td-js-sdk/pulls/92/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treasure-data/td-js-sdk/pulls/92/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treasure-data/td-js-sdk/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treasure-data/td-js-sdk/issues/92/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/treasure-data/td-js-sdk/statuses/a9c77f2787257898dc9c23a965a6be579668a495","head":{"label":"treasure-data:e2e-refactor","ref":"e2e-refactor","sha":"a9c77f2787257898dc9c23a965a6be579668a495","user":{"login":"treasure-data","id":747746,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/747746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data","html_url":"https://github.com/treasure-data","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20978591,"name":"td-js-sdk","full_name":"treasure-data/td-js-sdk","owner":{"login":"treasure-data","id":747746,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/747746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data","html_url":"https://github.com/treasure-data","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/treasure-data/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/treasure-data/td-js-sdk","description":"JavaScript
