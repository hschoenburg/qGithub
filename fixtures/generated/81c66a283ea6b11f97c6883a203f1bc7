I think that would be acceptable, Apple doesn't even release OS's for these phones anymore.\r\n\r\nAnyway, let me know what you all think.  cc @malgorithms @maxtaco "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/comments/363140012","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10419#issuecomment-363140012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10419","id":363140012,"user":{"login":"malgorithms","id":614943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/614943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms","html_url":"https://github.com/malgorithms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-05T16:33:27Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T16:33:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"(this was great with me)"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-05T16:33:27Z","org":{"id":5400834,"login":"keybase","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/keybase","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?"}},{"id":"7155540927","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":614943,"login":"malgorithms","display_login":"malgorithms","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614943?"},"repo":{"id":29099181,"name":"keybase/client","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10337","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10337/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10337/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10337/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10337","id":291768852,"number":10337,"title":"osx: simple multi-user KBFS support on macOS","user":{"login":"strib","id":8516691,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8516691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib","html_url":"https://github.com/strib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strib/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-01-26T01:04:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T13:15:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10337","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10337","diff_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10337.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10337.patch"},"body":"This PR updates the osx installer and helper to support multiple OS users all mounting KBFS.  Here's how it works:\r\n\r\n* For each user's mountpoint, it picks `~/Library/Application Support/Keybase/fs` as the mountpoint.  (Or whatever the user has set for the \"mountdir\" in `config.json`.)\r\n* When starting Keybase, it creates that directory, and tries to make a symlink to the mountpoint at `/keybase` via the root helper.\r\n* If it fails to make a `/keybase` symlink because the link is already pointing to another user, it pops up a simple alert box letting the user know where their mountpoint is:\r\n<img width=\"420\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-25 at 4 53 28 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8516691/35420110-8c4c1dd8-01f0-11e8-8ddf-2daa9e2cbd4e.png\">\r\n* When Keybase shuts down, it removes the mountpoint for the user, but it does NOT remove the `/keybase` symlink, because we don't want one user to get used to having `/keybase`, and then let another (non-admin) user swap it out for something else later.\r\n\r\nNote that once #10335 is in, we should be giving users the correct links to their own mountpoints from the Keybase GUI.\r\n\r\nApparently we haven't built a new installer for a while, so I guess this ended up updating a bunch of project files.  You can ignore those I think, they are automatically generated.\r\n\r\nOne bummer is that the `/keybase` link is not cleaned up on application uninstall (i.e., dragging the application into the trash) -- I guess we'd have to build a custom uninstaller for that.\r\n\r\nNote that I still need to test this a bit more, but darwinbot is in a stuck state, so I'll hopefully get to that tomorrow.  It seems to work well for the things I've been able to test so far.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/comments/360781503","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10337#issuecomment-360781503","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10337","id":360781503,"user":{"login":"malgorithms","id":614943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/614943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms","html_url":"https://github.com/malgorithms","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T13:15:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T13:15:13Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"looks good.

The mountpoint defaults to `~/.local/share/keybase/fs`, but can be overriden with the `$XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable.\r\n* The first user to use `run_keybase` gets the /keybase symlink (via `mount1`) forever. If the symlink is already taken, `run_keybase` prints out a message like:\r\n> Your mountpoint is /home/strib2/.local/share/keybase/fs; consider `ln -s /home/strib2/.local/share/keybase/fs ~/keybase\"\r\n* On upgrades, the install process forcibly unmounts `/keybase` and turns `/keybase` into a symlink pointing to the readme directory, as above.\r\n* For systemd, we now pass a `$KEYBASE_MOUNTDIR` env var to both KBFS and the service.\r\n* `keybase status` now prints out the KBFS mountpoint based on the `$KEYBASE_MOUNTDIR` environment variable, if it's available.\r\n* This also adds Dockerfiles for testing package-level stuff in different distros, and instructions on how to do so.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes will come to macOS in a future PR; for now it is unchanged.\r\n\r\nIssue:

(Maybe back in wireframing?)  My understanding when someone was kicked out of a team for a reset was:\r\n\r\n- they would no longer be in the member list. effectively, they would not be on the team.\r\n- there would be some attention-getting for admins (badging and a banner on the team page?), telling the admin that the person was removed and to add them back in if interested. @cecileboucheron  do you recall? In any case, we at least have the email right now.\r\n \r\nI'm curious what  the advantage is of keeping  them in the list, but showing as \"inactive\"? I fear a few things:\r\n\r\n(1) \"inactive\" sounds like they're still on the team, just not doing anything...it leads to a lot of questions - can they read the chats still? they can just sign in to become active again, right?\r\n(2) this feels like there's no clear action the admins are supposed to be doing to deal with the row.\r\n\r\nFollow-up question: what happens if an admin clicks this row? \r\n\r\nI would say the row should stay if (1) it's made clearer as an action item, and (2) it leads to the admin(s) making a decision. \r\n\r\nIf there's some reason the row has to stay short-term and we can't really solve any of that, I would just avoid the word \"inactive\", and put a red label on it like \"action needed\" and a line underneath that says \"(username) is cryptographically locked out due to an account reset; admins can invite them back in.\"  or something like that that is educational?\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2017-12-06T13:44:05Z","org":{"id":5400834,"login":"keybase","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/keybase","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?"}},{"id":"6940166997","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":614943,"login":"malgorithms","display_login":"malgorithms","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malgorithms","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614943?"},"repo":{"id":17025114,"name":"keybase/keybase-issues","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/3122","id":277370752,"number":3122,"title":"API
