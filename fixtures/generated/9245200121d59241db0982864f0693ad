Changed `AddMemberTx` API to expose two functions: `AddMemberByUsername` and  `AddMemberByUV` which resolve and load user and call internal `addMemberByUPKV2`.\r\n2. Added `tx.CompleteInviteByID(uv, inviteId)` which finds ChangeMembership payload in tx which adds `uv` and inserts inviteId to `CompletedInvite` of that payload. This function will fail with an error if the uv was never added successfully to the transaction, or it was added as keybase invite.\r\n3. Migrated Seitan handler to use AddMemberTx instead of figuring links on its own. Sometimes it has to post two types of link: change_membership for adding users, and invite for canceling obsolete invites; AddMemberTx makes it easier and safer.\r\n4. Made `tx.CancelInvite` public API, Seitan handler uses it to cancel \"obsolete\" seitan invitations (if user is already in team with higher role). \r\n5. Added more Seitan tests, especially `TestTeamHandleMultipleSeitans` that simulates notification with multiple seitan entries where different results are expected for each entry. E.g. failure to complete one seitan should not abort the entire process.","created_at":"2018-02-20T19:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T16:46:34Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d0c9811ba72b1ffef0c9e706dfe8b4422d715fbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/statuses/c328b3126fd17d38bffb6e5cd4cea4e9cdd0812b","head":{"label":"keybase:zapu/CORE-7160-seitan-team-tx","ref":"zapu/CORE-7160-seitan-team-tx","sha":"c328b3126fd17d38bffb6e5cd4cea4e9cdd0812b","user":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29099181,"name":"client","full_name":"keybase/client","owner":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client","description":"Keybase
