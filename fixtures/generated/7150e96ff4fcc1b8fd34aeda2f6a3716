I've replicated the issue here; https://github.com/mtscanlan/Personal/tree/master/ServiceFabricRuntimeIssue/ServiceFabricRuntimeIssue\r\n\r\nI found this post from @terrajobst that suggests migrating from project.json to PackageReference within the csproj file.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/31\r\n\r\nI did that here in this repo;\r\nhttps://github.com/mtscanlan/Personal/tree/master/ServiceFabricRuntimeIssue/ServiceFabricPackageReferenceFix\r\n\r\nThe Service Fabric publish now fails deployment with the following output;\r\n> An unhandled exception of type 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' occurred in Unknown Module.\r\nCould not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Diagnostics.EventFlow.ServiceFabric, Version=1.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where to go from here, in the same repo we have a netcoreapp2.0 project that depends on the netstandard2.0 library as well which runs fine.
