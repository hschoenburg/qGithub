Therefore, changes made should not result in a breaking change or need to write new tests (I tend to come from the camp that tests aren't there to validate a system, they're there to make sure I didn't break anything when I refactor and to document how the code works for other developers - replacement of technical specifications and other related documentation).\r\n\r\nRe-engineering: \r\n\r\n> \"Software Re-engineering is the examination and alteration of a system to reconstitute it in a new form.\" [decent Slideshare??](https://www.slideshare.net/deshpandeamrut/software-re-engineering-14736929) where I got the definition - first result in Google; so, totally adding the disclaimer. 😉 "}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T19:01:14Z","org":{"id":19886934,"login":"markedjs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/markedjs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19886934?"}},{"id":"7311787008","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":19642312,"login":"intcreator","display_login":"intcreator","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intcreator","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19642312?"},"repo":{"id":2096579,"name":"markedjs/marked","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1092","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1092/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1092/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1092/events","html_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1092","id":300628924,"number":1092,"title":"Auto-linking - cm_autolinks test","user":{"login":"joshbruce","id":15252830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbruce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":771365397,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"5319e7","default":false},{"id":766819535,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/question","name":"question","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-02-27T13:28:47Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T18:53:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"**Marked version:** 0.3.17\r\n\r\n**Proposal type:** other\r\n\r\n## What pain point are you perceiving?\r\n\r\nTravis CI is still in untrustworthy state because we have a failing test: `cm_autolinks`\r\n\r\nI don't think auto-linking is a feature from a specification is it?

I'm a security researcher at Virginia Tech.\r\n\r\nThe npm module marked has 2 regular expressions vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable expressions are listed below.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know, catastrophic backtracking is when the regex engine takes more than linear time to scan a string.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of resources about it on the web. I have included some starting points below.\r\n\r\nCatastrophic backtracking is particularly problematic if two conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. The module is used by server processes, and\r\n2. The regex can be reached by user input.\r\n\r\nPlease evaluate whether these conditions apply to your users and your regexes.\r\n\r\nHowever, copy/pasting regexes is quite common. Even if one or both conditions fail now,\r\nthese regexes may be a time bomb in your code for later -- you might still want to fix it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your module is used on the client side, consider whether a server-side counterpart might re-use this pattern later.\r\n\r\nFix advice:\r\n\r\nIf you want to make fixes, here are the most common approaches with examples:\r\n1. Refactor the regex pattern\r\n   - https://github.com/killmenot/valid-data-url/commit/64bad3cf1eff246103d71b51f945d7ea73bf7adf\r\n   - https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint/commit/eec921cee4327d7fe02ba6812bc39dc29f46b12a\r\n2. Replace the regex with custom parsing\r\n   - https://github.com/jshttp/forwarded/commit/d469116eda4931fbe1c0ccb29497b35930bfa328\r\n   - https://github.com/kriskowal/q-io/commit/b9c54c809c48306835506a3baad5dab67bec9dab\r\n3.

I am happy to test a refactored regex with my tools -- send me an email with the commit ID.\r\n2. Existing GitHub projects for regex testing are:\r\n   - substack's safe-regex project (https://github.com/substack/safe-regex) -- easy to install, has false positives and some bugs\r\n   - Weideman's RegexStaticAnalysis project (https://github.com/NicolaasWeideman/RegexStaticAnalysis) -- a bit more work to install, may have false positives\r\n\r\nIf this is a new topic for you, here are some good starting points for information:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/backtracking-in-regular-expressions\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/best-practices#Backtracking\r\n- https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow, here are the vulnerable patterns with attack details.\r\n\r\nEach vulnerability has the following keys, explained in more detail below:\r\n\r\n - pattern\r\n - filesIn (as of December/January; I excluded any appearances in irrelevant-looking dirs, and in '.min' files)\r\n - stringLenFor10Sec\r\n - nPumpsFor10Sec\r\n - attackFormat\r\n - blowupCurve\r\n\r\nThe attack format describes how to generate an attack string.\r\n\r\nOn my machine, an attack string generated using nPumpsFor10Sec repetitions (\"pumps\") of the pump string(s) blocks the js regex engine for 10 seconds, though this will vary based on your hardware.\r\n\r\nCompose an attack string like this:\r\n\r\n  'prefix 1' + 'pump 1' X times + 'prefix 2' + 'pump 2' X times + ... + suffix\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n  With pumpPairs: [{'prefix': 'a', 'pump': 'b'}], suffix: 'c', an attack string with three pumps would be:\r\n\r\n    abbbc\r\n\r\nCatastrophic backtracking blows up at either an exponential rate or a super-linear (power law) rate.\r\n\r\nThe blowupCurve indicates how severe the blow-up is.\r\n\r\nThe 'type' is either EXP(onential) or POW(er law) in the number of pumps (x).\r\n\r\nThe 'parms' are the parameters for the two curve types. The second parameter is more important, because:\r\n\r\n- EXP: f(x) = parms[0] * parms[1]^x\r\n- POW: f(x) = parms[0] * x^parms[1]\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend you address any EXP(onential) blow-ups.\r\n\r\nPOW(er law) blow-ups vary in their severity depending on the value of the second parameter, and in the length of the attack string ('stringLenFor10Sec').\r\n\r\nBut they are still a legitimate attack vector.\r\n\r\nJSON formatted:\r\n\r\nVuln 1:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n   \"attackFormat\" : {\r\n      \"suffix\" : \"!\\\\\",\r\n      \"pumpPairs\" : [\r\n         {\r\n            \"prefix\" : \"![\",\r\n            \"pump\" : \"\\\\[[]\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   },\r\n   \"pattern\" : \"^!?\\\\[((?:\\\\[[^\\\\]]*\\\\]|\\\\\\\\[\\\\[\\\\]]|[^\\\\[\\\\]])*)\\\\]\",\r\n   \"filesIn\" : [\r\n      [\r\n         \"lib/marked.js\"\r\n      ]\r\n   ],\r\n   \"blowupCurve\" : {\r\n      \"parms\" : [\r\n         0.000686698017502894,\r\n         0.320195646568061\r\n      ],\r\n      \"type\" : \"EXP\",\r\n      \"r2\" : 0.982167673285096\r\n   },\r\n   \"stringLenFor10Sec\" : 124,\r\n   \"nPumpsFor10Sec\" : \"30\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nVuln 2:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n   \"pattern\" : \"<tag(?:\\\"[^\\\"]*\\\"|'[^']*'|\\\\s[^'\\\"\\\\/>]*)*?\\\\/?>\",\r\n   \"attackFormat\" : {\r\n      \"suffix\" : \"<\\\"\\t/>a'a\",\r\n      \"pumpPairs\" : [\r\n         {\r\n            \"prefix\" : \"<tag\",\r\n            \"pump\" : \"\\t\\t\\\"\\\"\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   },\r\n   \"nPumpsFor10Sec\" : \"30\",\r\n   \"stringLenFor10Sec\" : 132,\r\n   \"blowupCurve\" : {\r\n      \"r2\" : 0.98785310777975,\r\n      \"type\" : \"EXP\",\r\n      \"parms\" : [\r\n         0.000399342208756204,\r\n         0.338098864022787\r\n      ]\r\n   },\r\n   \"filesIn\" : [\r\n      [\r\n         \"lib/marked.js\"\r\n      ]\r\n   ]\r\n}\r\n```"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T17:53:37Z","org":{"id":19886934,"login":"markedjs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/markedjs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19886934?"}},{"id":"7311480980","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":15252830,"login":"joshbruce","display_login":"joshbruce","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?"},"repo":{"id":2096579,"name":"markedjs/marked","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1070","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1070/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1070/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1070/events","html_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1070","id":299110548,"number":1070,"title":"Backtracking vulnerability","user":{"login":"joshbruce","id":15252830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbruce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":844536828,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/L0%20-%20security","name":"L0 - security","color":"ce4f48","default":false},{"id":766807993,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/help%20wanted","name":"help wanted","color":"0e8a16","default":true},{"id":766819535,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/question","name":"question","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2018-02-21T20:08:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:53:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"My name is James. I'm a security researcher at Virginia Tech.\r\n\r\nThe npm module marked has 2 regular expressions vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable expressions are listed below.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know, catastrophic backtracking is when the regex engine takes more than linear time to scan a string.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of resources about it on the web. I have included some starting points below.\r\n\r\nCatastrophic backtracking is particularly problematic if two conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. The module is used by server processes, and\r\n2. The regex can be reached by user input.\r\n\r\nPlease evaluate whether these conditions apply to your users and your regexes.\r\n\r\nHowever, copy/pasting regexes is quite common. Even if one or both conditions fail now,\r\nthese regexes may be a time bomb in your code for later -- you might still want to fix it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your module is used on the client side, consider whether a server-side counterpart might re-use this pattern later.\r\n\r\nFix advice:\r\n\r\nIf you want to make fixes, here are the most common approaches with examples:\r\n1. Refactor the regex pattern\r\n   - https://github.com/killmenot/valid-data-url/commit/64bad3cf1eff246103d71b51f945d7ea73bf7adf\r\n   - https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint/commit/eec921cee4327d7fe02ba6812bc39dc29f46b12a\r\n2. Replace the regex with custom parsing\r\n   - https://github.com/jshttp/forwarded/commit/d469116eda4931fbe1c0ccb29497b35930bfa328\r\n   - https://github.com/kriskowal/q-io/commit/b9c54c809c48306835506a3baad5dab67bec9dab\r\n3.

Other question is, do we think we have the ability to keep up??\r\n\r\nFrom a product perspective, I think it could go a long way to helping us hear more from users who are interested enough to at least sign up for the group. (That's been a serious pain point for me...how do I increase stakeholder reach out and feedback.)\r\n\r\nMaybe something we could start, but not really advertise and go from there.

I don't have email notifications turned on - I go to it when I want to, not when it gets all up in my face. See Randy Pausch on [Time Management](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0). \"Notifications are interruptions\" [and I got stuff to do]. 😉 \r\n2. Here's the rule (if all of the following are true):\r\n  - If \"from\" contains \"@github.com\" (all the GitHub emails)\r\n  - If \"subject\" contains \"[account]/[repo]\" (all the ones from that repo)\r\n  - If \"Message content\" does NOT contain \"@joshbruce\" (not explicitly for me, woohoo!)\r\n  - Then \"Move message\" to mailbox: \"[repo specific mailbox]\"\r\n3.

I'm a security researcher at Virginia Tech.\r\n\r\nThe npm module marked has 2 regular expressions vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable expressions are listed below.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know, catastrophic backtracking is when the regex engine takes more than linear time to scan a string.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of resources about it on the web. I have included some starting points below.\r\n\r\nCatastrophic backtracking is particularly problematic if two conditions are met:\r\n\r\n1. The module is used by server processes, and\r\n2. The regex can be reached by user input.\r\n\r\nPlease evaluate whether these conditions apply to your users and your regexes.\r\n\r\nHowever, copy/pasting regexes is quite common. Even if one or both conditions fail now,\r\nthese regexes may be a time bomb in your code for later -- you might still want to fix it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your module is used on the client side, consider whether a server-side counterpart might re-use this pattern later.\r\n\r\nFix advice:\r\n\r\nIf you want to make fixes, here are the most common approaches with examples:\r\n1. Refactor the regex pattern\r\n   - https://github.com/killmenot/valid-data-url/commit/64bad3cf1eff246103d71b51f945d7ea73bf7adf\r\n   - https://github.com/htmllint/htmllint/commit/eec921cee4327d7fe02ba6812bc39dc29f46b12a\r\n2. Replace the regex with custom parsing\r\n   - https://github.com/jshttp/forwarded/commit/d469116eda4931fbe1c0ccb29497b35930bfa328\r\n   - https://github.com/kriskowal/q-io/commit/b9c54c809c48306835506a3baad5dab67bec9dab\r\n3. Apply input sanitization, suitable if legitimate input strings are (much) shorter than the attack string\r\n   - https://github.com/hgoebl/mobile-detect.js/commit/7222f6e75cf8cd90e1dc53e445716203eaf79d8a\r\n   - https://github.com/node-modules/charset/commit/effda0c48c51b47a47f4cad7db0c51ee7407cc1b\r\n\r\nYou can study other examples using the links from Snyk.io's vulnerability database: https://snyk.io/vuln/?packageManager=all\r\n\r\nValidating your fix:\r\n\r\n1. I am happy to test a refactored regex with my tools -- send me an email with the commit ID.\r\n2. Existing GitHub projects for regex testing are:\r\n   - substack's safe-regex project (https://github.com/substack/safe-regex) -- easy to install, has false positives and some bugs\r\n   - Weideman's RegexStaticAnalysis project (https://github.com/NicolaasWeideman/RegexStaticAnalysis) -- a bit more work to install, may have false positives\r\n\r\nIf this is a new topic for you, here are some good starting points for information:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/backtracking-in-regular-expressions\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/best-practices#Backtracking\r\n- https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNow, here are the vulnerable patterns with attack details.\r\n\r\nEach vulnerability has the following keys, explained in more detail below:\r\n\r\n - pattern\r\n - filesIn (as of December/January; I excluded any appearances in irrelevant-looking dirs, and in '.min' files)\r\n - stringLenFor10Sec\r\n - nPumpsFor10Sec\r\n - attackFormat\r\n - blowupCurve\r\n\r\nThe attack format describes how to generate an attack string.\r\n\r\nOn my machine, an attack string generated using nPumpsFor10Sec repetitions (\"pumps\") of the pump string(s) blocks the js regex engine for 10 seconds, though this will vary based on your hardware.\r\n\r\nCompose an attack string like this:\r\n\r\n  'prefix 1' + 'pump 1' X times + 'prefix 2' + 'pump 2' X times + ... + suffix\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n  With pumpPairs: [{'prefix': 'a', 'pump': 'b'}], suffix: 'c', an attack string with three pumps would be:\r\n\r\n    abbbc\r\n\r\nCatastrophic backtracking blows up at either an exponential rate or a super-linear (power law) rate.\r\n\r\nThe blowupCurve indicates how severe the blow-up is.\r\n\r\nThe 'type' is either EXP(onential) or POW(er law) in the number of pumps (x).\r\n\r\nThe 'parms' are the parameters for the two curve types. The second parameter is more important, because:\r\n\r\n- EXP: f(x) = parms[0] * parms[1]^x\r\n- POW: f(x) = parms[0] * x^parms[1]\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend you address any EXP(onential) blow-ups.\r\n\r\nPOW(er law) blow-ups vary in their severity depending on the value of the second parameter, and in the length of the attack string ('stringLenFor10Sec').\r\n\r\nBut they are still a legitimate attack vector.\r\n\r\nJSON formatted:\r\n\r\nVuln 1:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n   \"attackFormat\" : {\r\n      \"suffix\" : \"!\\\\\",\r\n      \"pumpPairs\" : [\r\n         {\r\n

If not, is there an easy alternative fix?\r\n\r\nHere is the [diff of Feder1co5oave's branch with Marked master](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/compare/master...Feder1co5oave:encode_url)."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T17:07:04Z","org":{"id":19886934,"login":"markedjs","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/markedjs","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19886934?"}},{"id":"7311203729","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":15252830,"login":"joshbruce","display_login":"joshbruce","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?"},"repo":{"id":2096579,"name":"markedjs/marked","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1100","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1100/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1100/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1100/events","html_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pull/1100","id":301079334,"number":1100,"title":"Update release template","user":{"login":"joshbruce","id":15252830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbruce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":771365397,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"5319e7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-02-28T15:56:59Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:03:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/pulls/1100","html_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pull/1100","diff_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pull/1100.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/pull/1100.patch"},"body":"**Marked version:** 0.3.17\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nSee [comment](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1097#issuecomment-369282046) from @intcreator for context.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps we can make clear which version of the spec each version of Marked adheres to so if people want compatibility available in a certain version of the spec they can use the corresponding version of Marked?

For example, these questions come to mind:\r\n\r\n1. Do we always start to adhere to the latest version of the spec immediately or wait to adopt it at a certain version/milestone?\r\n2. What happens when a user uses CommonMark vs GFM under the hood?\r\n3. Do we have plans for supporting other flavors/dialects of Markdown?\r\n\r\nEdit: I just discovered USAGE_EXTENSIBILITY.md, which may be a better home for some of this information.\r\n\r\n## What solution are you suggesting?\r\n\r\n1. Not until the identified version is 100%. Having said that, it does raise the question: Do we continue backward compatibility with previous versions of the spec?\r\n2. From a spec perspective, GFM just adds some concepts to CommonMark. Which raises a question of, do we really support specs; or, do we support certain implementations of concepts (tables, for example, are a concept available in both GFM _and_ MultiMarkdown). This is why we have that statement under the [supported specs](https://github.com/markedjs/marked#specifications) re possibly \"accidentally\" supporting other flavors. For 0.x I would say it's kind of a mess under the hood.\r\n3. I would say plans, but definitely something to consider moving into 2.x or even 1.x??"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/comments/369298216","html_url":"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1097#issuecomment-369298216","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/markedjs/marked/issues/1097","id":369298216,"user":{"login":"joshbruce","id":15252830,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15252830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbruce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbruce/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T16:34:17Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T16:34:17Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"1. 🎉 \r\n2.
