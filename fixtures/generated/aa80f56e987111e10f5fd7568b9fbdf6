we turn on the root redirector, we'll probably face some detractors who don't like us using a mountpoint in /.  I think it makes sense to give them a way to turn it off if they don't want it.\r\n\r\nSince the root redirector runs as root, we can't just use a config value in the normal user-based config.json, since there might be multiple users on the machine all using keybase.  So the idea here is to allow the user to optionally create a file at `/etc/keybase/config.json` as root, and populate it thusly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"disable-root-redirector\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll post instructions in the docs on how to stop the root redirector and delete `/keybase`, and when things get restarted, we won't try to start it up again.\r\n\r\nTo make that happen, this PR:\r\n* Adds new flags to `keybase config get` for:\r\n  * \"d, direct\": read a value directly from the config file, rather than relying on the Keybase service (and without launching a service, if one isn't already running).\r\n  * \"b, bare\": read a string from the config file without putting quotes around it.  (Not really needed for this PR, but helpful to avoid some sed-hacking in the scripts.)\r\n* Check the root config file in `run_keybase` and the Linux post-installer, and not starting the redirector if needed.\r\n* Check the root config file in OSX before starting the redirector.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco for the `keybase config get` changes.\r\n\r\nIssue:

we turn on the root redirector, we'll probably face some detractors who don't like us using a mountpoint in /.  I think it makes sense to give them a way to turn it off if they don't want it.\r\n\r\nSince the root redirector runs as root, we can't just use a config value in the normal user-based config.json, since there might be multiple users on the machine all using keybase.  So the idea here is to allow the user to optionally create a file at `/etc/keybase/config.json` as root, and populate it thusly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"disable-root-redirector\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll post instructions in the docs on how to stop the root redirector and delete `/keybase`, and when things get restarted, we won't try to start it up again.\r\n\r\nTo make that happen, this PR:\r\n* Adds new flags to `keybase config get` for:\r\n  * \"d, direct\": read a value directly from the config file, rather than relying on the Keybase service (and without launching a service, if one isn't already running).\r\n  * \"b, bare\": read a string from the config file without putting quotes around it.  (Not really needed for this PR, but helpful to avoid some sed-hacking in the scripts.)\r\n* Check the root config file in `run_keybase` and the Linux post-installer, and not starting the redirector if needed.\r\n* Check the root config file in OSX before starting the redirector.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco for the `keybase config get` changes.\r\n\r\nIssue:

getting this error when attempting to upload my public GPG key. I previously had the same key on keybase but it was expired.\r\n\r\nThis key appears freshly exported from GPG and looks something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\r\n\r\nmQINBFKmKTkBEADEwkkP4B2KFD5at2PwSsdfVZaASdlmylQ4ZF9AeQzz5dy2woy1\r\n...\r\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I export the private key it looks something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\r\n\r\nlQdGBFK...\r\n\r\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nI initially thought this was something similar to #184 but this is a working key that I've been using with GPG since 2013 so I'm pretty sure it's valid. \r\n\r\nYou can find the updated key I'm trying to use on mit key server - `E2804455` http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=E2804455&op=index\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the key it appears to not be expired, am I missing something?\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ gpg -v < ~/Downloads/Marshall\\ Jones\\ \\(E2804455\\)\\ –\\ Public.asc\r\ngpg: WARNING: no command supplied.
