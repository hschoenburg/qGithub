 That was really unclear, unless you're me...\r\n\r\nPlease disregard this, as after checking ruby docs at https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en and https://ruby-doc.org, it appears I must be doing something specific to show these constants in Socket.\r\n\r\nAt some point, the [`Socket::Constants`](https://msp-greg.github.io/ruby_trunk/socket/Socket.html) module definition in trunk is no longer found by the parsing, which also causes the constants in `Socket` to disappear.  But, the last parsing of 2.5 they are shown [here](https://msp-greg.github.io/ruby_2_5/socket/Socket.html).\r\n\r\nI've got notes regarding this type of code in my doc system, but they're scattered, and I haven't needed to regularly update the code.  I need to get all the notes into one file, as I don't recall where the doc system is parsing the info for `Socket::Constants`...\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure what's causing it, so I'll check later.  My doc site is generated locally, and pushed to GitHub, while ruby-loco is totally in the cloud (but I run locally for testing).\r\n\r\nMaybe this make a bit more sense, and thanks, Greg\r\n\r\nAside:

a file task depends on some non-file task indirectly,\r\nRake executes the file task even if its immediate prerequisite files have older timestamp.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the behavior changed at 12.1.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"rake/clean\"\r\n\r\nCLEAN.include(\"config.yml\", \"component\")\r\n\r\ntask \"setup\" do\r\n  puts Rake::VERSION\r\n  touch \"config.yml\"

puts \"[component]  #{File.exist?(t.name) && File.mtime(t.name)}\"\r\n  sleep 1\r\n  touch t.name\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the above Rakefile, clean up and create the \"component\" first.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rake clean && rake component\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe next `rake component` results in different behavior as follows.\r\nOn 12.0.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rake component --trace\r\n(in
