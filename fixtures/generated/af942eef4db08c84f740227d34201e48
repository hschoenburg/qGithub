exposes an `io.Reader` variable `Reader` as \"a global, shared instance of a cryptographically strong pseudo-random generator.\" Furthermore, `crypto/rand.Read` implicitly uses `Reader` for its crypto source.\r\n\r\nThis seems problematic to me because then any package can just overwrite `crypto/rand.Reader` to point to some other object, affecting the security of any packages that rely on `crypto/rand.Read` or `crypto/rand.Reader` for security, e.g. `x/crypto/nacl`.\r\n\r\nOne can say that a language can never ultimately defend against code running in your same process, but I think it should be possible to write something that depends on `crypto/rand` for security that wouldn't require auditing other packages for a single malicious variable write.[1]\r\n\r\nThe main API flaw here, IMO, is that `Reader` is an `io.Reader` variable, whereas it should be a function that returns an `io.Reader`. A new API would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Reader returns an io.Reader that reads from a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number generator.\r\nfunc Reader() io.Reader\r\n\r\n// Read is a helper function that calls Reader() and then passes it to io.ReadFull. \r\nfunc Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlas, with the Go 1 compatibility guarantee `Reader` would have to remain, and `Read` would still have to use `Reader`. But the above could be added as new functions, say `MakeReader()` and `SafeRead()`. And the standard library (and other important external packages like `x/crypto/nacl`) could be changed to use those safe functions.\r\n\r\n[1] Without this flaw, a malicious package would have to use the unsafe package to poke around in the internals of `crypto/rand`, or call out to the external OS to e.g. try to redirect access to the random device, which seems easier to audit for than a write to `crypto/rand.Reader`. Of course, I'm already assuming that a project worried about this is vendoring all of its dependencies."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/comments/369031283","html_url":"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24160#issuecomment-369031283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/24160","id":369031283,"user":{"login":"songgao","id":255797,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/255797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao","html_url":"https://github.com/songgao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/songgao/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T21:24:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T21:24:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just

It uses `nohup` even for the systemd case, because a) it's a very simple service, b) if it crashes it's no big deal, KBFS will still be working at the per-use mountpoint, and c) it's easy to start it again with another call to `run_keybase`. Redirector logs go in `/home/$USER/.cache/keybase/keybase.redirector.log` if the redirector is started this way.  \r\n\r\nIssue:

installs the `keybase-redirector` binary for linux packages.  Right now it just builds the Go one for testing; I'll merge this in on a branch (not `master` yet) and update it for the Rust redirector once that's ready.\r\n\r\nThe post-install script:\r\n\r\n* Removes `keybasehelper` and various directories that are no longer needed.\r\n* If the `/keybase` symlink is present, it gets removed and, if KBFS is currently mounted somewhere, the redirector is run in its place.\r\n* If there's a regular mount at `/keybase` from some older package (owned by some non-root user), it unmounts KBFS and makes `/keybase` owned by root.  It doesn't start the redirector by default in this case, since some user needs to run `run_keybase` anyway.\r\n* If there's already a redirector running at `/keybase`, it gets killed and restarted by root, in case the binary has been updated in this package.\r\n* If this is a fresh install, it prepares the `/keybase` directory but doesn't run the redirector yet.\r\n* Redirector logs go in `/root/.cache/keybase/keybase.redirector.log` if the redirector is started this way.\r\n\r\nThe `run_keybase` script attempts to launch the root redirector under `nohup` as whatever user runs the script.  This assumes that the redirector will quit silently, with a 0 exit code, if its already running.  It uses `nohup` even for the systemd case, because a) it's a very simple service, b) if it crashes it's no big deal, KBFS will still be working at the per-use mountpoint, and c) it's easy to start it again with another call to `run_keybase`. Redirector logs go in `/home/$USER/.cache/keybase/keybase.redirector.log` if the redirector is started this way.  \r\n\r\nIssue:

It uses `nohup` even for the systemd case, because a) it's a very simple service, b) if it crashes it's no big deal, KBFS will still be working at the per-use mountpoint, and c) it's easy to start it again with another call to `run_keybase`. Redirector logs go in `/home/$USER/.cache/keybase/keybase.redirector.log` if the redirector is started this way.  \r\n\r\nIssue:
