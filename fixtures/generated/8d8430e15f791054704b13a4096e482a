Changed `AddMemberTx` API to expose two functions: `AddMemberByUsername` and  `AddMemberByUV` which resolve and load user and call internal `addMemberByUPKV2`.\r\n2. Added `tx.CompleteInviteByID(uv, inviteId)` which finds ChangeMembership payload in tx which adds `uv` and inserts inviteId to `CompletedInvite` of that payload. This function will fail with an error if the uv was never added successfully to the transaction, or it was added as keybase invite.\r\n3. Migrated Seitan handler to use AddMemberTx instead of figuring links on its own. Sometimes it has to post two types of link: change_membership for adding users, and invite for canceling obsolete invites; AddMemberTx makes it easier and safer.\r\n4. Made `tx.CancelInvite` public API, Seitan handler uses it to cancel \"obsolete\" seitan invitations (if user is already in team with higher role). \r\n5. Added more Seitan tests, especially `TestTeamHandleMultipleSeitans` that simulates notification with multiple seitan entries where different results are expected for each entry. E.g. failure to complete one seitan should not abort the entire process.","created_at":"2018-02-20T19:24:20Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:19:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d02607b50324945e4691eda242136f1ab3e560c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10616/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10616/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10616/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/statuses/4332203f60779e9b69a69eeaf7ec35e1c4f33e8f","head":{"label":"keybase:zapu/CORE-7160-seitan-team-tx","ref":"zapu/CORE-7160-seitan-team-tx","sha":"4332203f60779e9b69a69eeaf7ec35e1c4f33e8f","user":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29099181,"name":"client","full_name":"keybase/client","owner":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client","description":"Keybase

Changed `AddMemberTx` API to expose two functions: `AddMemberByUsername` and  `AddMemberByUV` which resolve and load user and call internal `addMemberByUPKV2`.\r\n2. Added `tx.CompleteInviteByID(uv, inviteId)` which finds ChangeMembership payload in tx which adds `uv` and inserts inviteId to `CompletedInvite` of that payload. This function will fail with an error if the uv was never added successfully to the transaction, or it was added as keybase invite.\r\n3. Migrated Seitan handler to use AddMemberTx instead of figuring links on its own. Sometimes it has to post two types of link: change_membership for adding users, and invite for canceling obsolete invites; AddMemberTx makes it easier and safer.\r\n4. Made `tx.CancelInvite` public API, Seitan handler uses it to cancel \"obsolete\" seitan invitations (if user is already in team with higher role). \r\n5. Added more Seitan tests, especially `TestTeamHandleMultipleSeitans` that simulates notification with multiple seitan entries where different results are expected for each entry. E.g. failure to complete one seitan should not abort the entire process."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/comments/369246610","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client/pull/10616#issuecomment-369246610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10616","id":369246610,"user":{"login":"zapu","id":451974,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/451974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu","html_url":"https://github.com/zapu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T13:57:30Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:57:30Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mlsteele

Before this PR it bypassed\r\n1. Is this the junderwood you wanted? [Y/n]\r\n\r\nBut did _not_ bypass\r\n\r\n2. Some proofs failed; still follow junderwood? [y/N]\r\n3. We found an account for junderwood, but they haven't proven their identity. Still follow them? [y/N]\r\n\r\nThere may be other prompts that I missed.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it so that case 3 defaults to yes `[Y/n]` and _is_ bypassed by `-y`. Case 2 is unchanged. The rationale here is that it if you are following a username with `-y` it's very likely ok with you that they have no proofs. Case 2 is more serious and it's helpful to encourage people to fix broken proofs.\r\n\r\ncc @maxtaco in case you have an

goals of this PR are:\r\n1. Change `TeamCreateWithSettings` to post one less link by adding admin to subteam using SubteamHead link instead of separate ChangeMembership link. There is slight API change: `addSelfAs keybase1.TeamRole` argument in `teams.CreateSubteam`.\r\n2. When creating a subteam without staying in, create subteam with self as `WRITER`, so chat channel can be initialized, but when leaving user does not have to downgrade themselves first.\r\n3. When creating a subteam to stay, add self as `ADMIN`. This also has nice effect of creating just one `SubteamHead` link.\r\n4. Add a test to lock-in the behaviour of initialising chat channel when creating a team. It's in `team_create_test.go`.\r\n5. Chat-related smuUser test functions were moved from `team_reset_test.go` to `multiuser_common_test.go` to encourage use from other test files, not necessarily related to resets.\r\n\r\nIn general, the case of creating a team and leaving it was optimized from 5 links:\r\n`SubteamHead, ChangeMembership (add self as admin), ChangeMembership (downgrade self to writer), Leave, RotateKey`\r\nto 3 links:\r\n`SubteamHead (with self as writer), Leave, RotateKey`.","created_at":"2018-02-26T17:07:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T15:50:54Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T15:50:54Z","merged_at":"2018-02-27T15:50:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"6ff387cb8a449dd5de88a9f0636b75e429422441","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/10690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/issues/10690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/client/statuses/921c884aa1116da3a542be04b6d4eef338dd51ee","head":{"label":"keybase:zapu/optimize-create-subteam","ref":"zapu/optimize-create-subteam","sha":"921c884aa1116da3a542be04b6d4eef338dd51ee","user":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29099181,"name":"client","full_name":"keybase/client","owner":{"login":"keybase","id":5400834,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keybase/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/client","description":"Keybase

Change `TeamCreateWithSettings` to post one less link by adding admin to subteam using SubteamHead link instead of separate ChangeMembership link. There is slight API change: `addSelf` argument in `teams.CreateSubteam`.\r\n2. Add a test to lock-in the behaviour of initialising chat channel when creating a team.
