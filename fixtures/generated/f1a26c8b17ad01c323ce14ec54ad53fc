You could just as easily create a platform which verifies a user based on private posts--however, that completely and utterly defeats the purpose of Keybase. The idea is for _publicly verifiable_ proofs so one is not required to rely on Facebook, Twitter, and even Keybase. That user is able to _check for themselves_ the proof you've posted and verify it themselves--even away from Keybase if they're so inclined.\r\n\r\n> I would like to propose that instead of using posts or tweets, allow people to add a special link to their Facebook and Twitter bios (or some other metadata field).\r\n\r\nThis is something that's been discussed before. It was pretty well received IIRC. A decent idea to be sure.\r\n\r\n> I'm determined to never publish a public Facebook post and I have no plans to ever tweet a Keybase verification.\r\n\r\nThe entire point of Keybase is people who don't personally know you can have a high degree of confidence that you are who you say you are via cryptography and public proofs. The entire point of privately posting something to your friends is people you don't personally know and/or approve cannot see your posts...\r\n\r\nThese two ideas are entirely antithetical."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-15T01:42:03Z","org":{"id":5400834,"login":"keybase","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/keybase","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?"}},{"id":"7227635265","type":"WatchEvent","actor":{"id":239193,"login":"zQueal","display_login":"zQueal","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239193?"},"repo":{"id":71056775,"name":"kovidgoyal/kitty","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kovidgoyal/kitty"},"payload":{"action":"started"},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-10T22:53:57Z"},{"id":"7214115532","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":239193,"login":"zQueal","display_login":"zQueal","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239193?"},"repo":{"id":17025114,"name":"keybase/keybase-issues","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1669","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1669/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1669/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1669/events","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1669","id":94955250,"number":1669,"title":"proof request: airbnb","user":{"login":"privong","id":1630295,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1630295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong","html_url":"https://github.com/privong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/privong/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2015-07-14T14:20:51Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T00:29:51Z","closed_at":"2018-02-07T03:41:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"It might be useful for people to prove ownership of airbnb accounts.

How, exactly do you propose that happens? Even if it's not done through Keybase, if a user wants to assert your identity it's going to happen. Whether it be via Keybase tracking, or they find your public PGP key, sign it, and release it to a key server. The only safeguard is to not have a key.\r\n\r\nThe only __issue__ here seems to be some sort of social phobia of user `Y` seeing user `X` on your Keybase profile page and making some form of social connection. _That's not what tracking is, or what it's for_. This has been my issue from the very beginning. \"Tracking\" is too much of a social term, and is open to asinine interpretation for reasons other than its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nAssert(ions), instead of track(ing) has been the best alternative term I've seen or am likely to see. When tracking a user you're asking Keybase to monitor their key for change, and are simultaneously adding to the user WOT by saying \"hey, I believe this person is who they say.\"\r\n\r\nTracking a user for any other reason defeats the entire purpose of the feature. So does the interpretation or insinuation that a tracked user must then have a personal relationship with the Keybase user and visa versa.\r\n\r\nImplementing a feature which would decrease the user WOT (profile blocking) by removing tracked/tracking users from your profile page does _nothing_ but decrease the confidence in a users identity so you can somehow safe face. IMO it make zero sense. \r\n\r\nKeybase already has the `--local` flag to be able to track users locally without publishing it to the web interface. If anything when tracking someone publicly a notification should be sent to the end user requesting permission to make the assertion public. If you decline then it's not published on the web interface, but it could still be verified by the key itself, or by examining the merkle tree. This would ease your social phobias without interfering with the tracking feature.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to be associated with XX user, then my advice is to not have public profiles...."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-01-14T23:14:42Z","org":{"id":5400834,"login":"keybase","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/keybase","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5400834?"}},{"id":"7085112385","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":239193,"login":"zQueal","display_login":"zQueal","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/239193?"},"repo":{"id":18464687,"name":"asapach/peerflix-server","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127/events","html_url":"https://github.com/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127","id":279615007,"number":127,"title":"Running Multiple instances of peerflix-server","user":{"login":"pavs","id":3807064,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3807064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs","html_url":"https://github.com/pavs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":90383215,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-12-06T03:35:33Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T09:49:13Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I want to run multiple instances of peerflix-server with it's own config file (ie, peerflix-server -config2.json)\r\nMore specifically in regards to storing downloaded torrents location.\r\n\r\nIs it possible?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/comments/356882016","html_url":"https://github.com/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127#issuecomment-356882016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asapach/peerflix-server/issues/127","id":356882016,"user":{"login":"zQueal","id":239193,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/239193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal","html_url":"https://github.com/zQueal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T09:49:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T09:49:13Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I've also confirmed this working with multiple unix users.

How will the names be used?\n\nWhat's the idea when a device is lost or compromised?\n\nI'd like to be informed about not only the technical reason it has to be this way, but how to work with it.\n\nPeople may have different setups including several similar devices. Can we develop a generic naming scheme?\n\n`<DeviceType>-<ID>-<Iteration>` or `<DeviceName>-<Iteration>`?\nFirst laptop: `Laptop-1-1`. After first recreation (lost/compromised/...): `Laptop-1-2`.\nThird phone fourth iteration: `Phone-3-4`.\nI imagine many people have a `Laptop-Work`. Third work laptop first iteration: `Laptop-Work-3-1`.\nI call my laptop `HipAir` (which I initially used and then reset my Keybase account). `HipAir-2` would conceivably be the next name I'd use following that convention.\n\nI guess we could omit the identifying `-1` on the first iteration, but will likely need a number eventually and consistency is often useful.\n\n> we want people to be able to think of devices by name - say, when seeing them in a list, or when talking about them - and never have to think about key fingerprints or id's.\n\nHow compatible can a naming scheme be with that?\n\nLoss and compromise shouldn't be more of a hassle than it already is. People shouldn't be discouraged to discontinue use of a compromised key for the sole purpose of keeping a clean device name.\n\nIs there no way we can reuse names such as `Laptop` and `Phone`? Perhaps it's actually impossible, but can the sigchain not be used to track updates of device name to ID mappings? I realise there may be user experience difficulties, but the current situation seems to have issues as well.\n## Relevant\n\nBased on discussion from https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1952 “Unable to add previous device name on reset account”.\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/comments/352275522","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2231#issuecomment-352275522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/2231","id":352275522,"user":{"login":"zQueal","id":239193,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/239193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal","html_url":"https://github.com/zQueal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zQueal/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-17T18:32:51Z","updated_at":"2017-12-17T18:32:51Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not too sure why it's such a big deal.
