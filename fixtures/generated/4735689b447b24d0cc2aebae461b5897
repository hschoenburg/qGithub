Nvidia proprietary driver 390.25 with a GTX 1060. I don't really have a way to test the built-in Intel iGPU because switching out Nvidia libGL for Mesa is always such a hassle. \r\n\r\nI believe Nvidia's own vsync is behaving properly, there is no tearing in the games themselves and no tearing in the video file when playing normally. Heavy tearing as soon as Xcomposite is enabled and targetting the game window. OBS doesn't even have to be recording for this to happen, it's enough to just select the window.\r\n\r\nIt happens on Plasma with Kwin compositing on or off, and with compton running or not running, nothing makes a difference.
