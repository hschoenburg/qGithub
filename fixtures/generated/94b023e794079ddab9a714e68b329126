The idea was that the built-in JSON manifester would no-longer be used, and all Jsonnet code would emit a string that is printed verbatim.  To make that practical, every execution would be implicitly wrapped by a manifester, by default std.manifestJson but you can specify arbitrary code on the commandline.  The -S mode just means use the identity function.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is that error stacktraces are bad when using this feature because any errors form user code get wrapped in a load of traces (especially for recursive formats like JSON) and the actual context also gets lost.  Actually it looks like this context is lost in go-jsonnet too:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndcunnin@dcunnin7:~$ jsonnet -e 'local thing = {x: error \"override x\"}; {y: thing {x: 1}, z: thing }' -t 100\r\nRUNTIME ERROR: override x\r\n        <cmdline>:1:19-37       object <thing>\r\n        <cmdline>:1:61-66       object <anonymous>\r\n        During manifestation\r\ndcunnin@dcunnin7:~$ jsonnet -e 'std.manifestJson(local thing = {x: error \"override x\"}; {y: thing {x: 1}, z: thing })' -t 100\r\nRUNTIME ERROR: override x\r\n        <cmdline>:1:36-54       object <v>\r\n        std.jsonnet:826:50-54   thunk <v>\r\n        std.jsonnet:801:16      thunk <a>\r\n        std.jsonnet:801:16-25   function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:801:16-25   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:826:46-85   thunk <array_element>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-27   thunk <a>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-35   function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-35   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:224:17-57   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:230:13-34   function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:829:17-36   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:826:46-85   thunk <array_element>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-27   thunk <a>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-35   function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:219:21-35   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:226:17-63   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:230:13-34   function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:829:17-36   function <aux>\r\n        std.jsonnet:830:9-27    function <anonymous>\r\n        std.jsonnet:797:27-60   function <anonymous>\r\n        <cmdline>:1:1-86\r\ndcunnin@dcunnin7:~$ go-jsonnet -e 'local thing = {x: error \"override x\"}; {y: thing {x: 1}, z: thing }' -t 100\r\nRUNTIME ERROR: override x\r\n        <cmdline>:1:19-37       object <thing>\r\n        During manifestation\r\n\r\ndcunnin@dcunnin7:~$ go-jsonnet -e 'std.manifestJson(local thing = {x: error \"override x\"}; {y: thing {x: 1}, z: thing })' -t 100\r\nRUNTIME ERROR: override x\r\n        <cmdline>:1:36-54       object <thing>\r\n        <std>:826:50-54 thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk <lines> from <function <aux>>>>>>\r\n        <std>:801:16-17 function <aux>\r\n        <std>:1036:29-30        thunk from <thunk <ta> from <function <anonymous>>>\r\n        <builtin>       builtin function <type>\r\n        <std>:1038:33-35        thunk from <function <anonymous>>\r\n        <builtin>       builtin function <primitiveEquals>\r\n        <std>:1038:12-40        function <anonymous>\r\n\r\n        <std>:826:46-85 thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk <lines> from <function <aux>>>>>\r\n        <std>:(825:44)-(826:85) thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk <lines> from <function <aux>>>>>\r\n        <builtin>       builtin function <join>\r\n        <std>:826:46-85 thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk <lines> from <function <aux>>>>>\r\n        <std>:(825:44)-(826:85) thunk from <thunk from <thunk from <thunk <lines> from <function <aux>>>>>\r\n        <builtin>       builtin function <join>\r\n        <std>:830:9-27  function <anonymous>\r\n        <std>:797:27-60 function <anonymous>\r\n        <cmdline>:1:1-86        $\r\n        During evaluation\r\n```\r\n\r\nA solution to make std.manifestJson work is to allow catching errors to inject the extra context (i.e. the path through the object) into the message / trace somehow.
