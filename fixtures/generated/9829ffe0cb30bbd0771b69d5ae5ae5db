we turn on the root redirector, we'll probably face some detractors who don't like us using a mountpoint in /.  I think it makes sense to give them a way to turn it off if they don't want it.\r\n\r\nSince the root redirector runs as root, we can't just use a config value in the normal user-based config.json, since there might be multiple users on the machine all using keybase.  So the idea here is to allow the user to optionally create a file at `/etc/keybase/config.json` as root, and populate it thusly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"disable-root-redirector\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll post instructions in the docs on how to stop the root redirector and delete `/keybase`, and when things get restarted, we won't try to start it up again.\r\n\r\nTo make that happen, this PR:\r\n* Adds new flags to `keybase config get` for:\r\n  * \"d, direct\": read a value directly from the config file, rather than relying on the Keybase service (and without launching a service, if one isn't already running).\r\n  * \"b, bare\": read a string from the config file without putting quotes around it.  (Not really needed for this PR, but helpful to avoid some sed-hacking in the scripts.)\r\n* Check the root config file in `run_keybase` and the Linux post-installer, and not starting the redirector if needed.\r\n* Check the root config file in OSX before starting the redirector.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco for the `keybase config get` changes.\r\n\r\nIssue:

we turn on the root redirector, we'll probably face some detractors who don't like us using a mountpoint in /.  I think it makes sense to give them a way to turn it off if they don't want it.\r\n\r\nSince the root redirector runs as root, we can't just use a config value in the normal user-based config.json, since there might be multiple users on the machine all using keybase.  So the idea here is to allow the user to optionally create a file at `/etc/keybase/config.json` as root, and populate it thusly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"disable-root-redirector\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll post instructions in the docs on how to stop the root redirector and delete `/keybase`, and when things get restarted, we won't try to start it up again.\r\n\r\nTo make that happen, this PR:\r\n* Adds new flags to `keybase config get` for:\r\n  * \"d, direct\": read a value directly from the config file, rather than relying on the Keybase service (and without launching a service, if one isn't already running).\r\n  * \"b, bare\": read a string from the config file without putting quotes around it.  (Not really needed for this PR, but helpful to avoid some sed-hacking in the scripts.)\r\n* Check the root config file in `run_keybase` and the Linux post-installer, and not starting the redirector if needed.\r\n* Check the root config file in OSX before starting the redirector.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco for the `keybase config get` changes.\r\n\r\nIssue:
