It's also something that really... makes implementation strange. There's a lot to think about around this issue wrt approaches and such.\r\n\r\nI think there's one decent way to handle this. One bool in the config file that turns on/off nickname registration + reservation.\r\n\r\nIf the bool is on, each account name acts as a reserved nickname. There's a new key on accounts, `grouped-nicks` (managed through traditional `GROUP`/etc commands with our fake NickServ client). You can `NICKSERV GHOST` people using your nickname, and people who change to a nick but aren't authenticated are asked to login, but not renamed off automagically unless the user's specifically asked for that (another bool, something like `kill-nick-squatters` that defaults to false and can be enabled with a call to NickServ).\r\n\r\nIf the bool is off, no reserving of nicknames exists at all. In addition, any existing `grouped-nicks` information is left alone, not updated nor removed. Any `GROUP`/related commands on NickServ fail out instantly with the reply _\"Nickname registration is not enabled\"_.\r\n\r\nWe'll want to show appropriate help information for `NICKSERV REGISTER` whether nickname reservation is enabled or disabled.

Is there any point to that `tab.opts` key? The `tab` dictionary itself already has a `num` key – sticking an `ordnum` in there during the first loop is no problem. All the other data in the `tab.opts` dictionary is used only inside the callback function, which can just use `getbufvar()` and friends itself. So the sub-dictionary is redundant, the callback can just receive the `tab` itself.\r\n\r\nThere's no real \"point\" to the `opts` dictionary - flattening it into the `tab` dictionary would be fine - I mostly kept them separate for my own benefit while trying to unravel exactly how the rendering worked. I do think there is value in pre-calculating all the values of that dictionary, however, as it allows the rendering function to be pure, and also keeps that complexity out of it. My goal with this structure was keeping the rendering function as dumb as possible.\r\n\r\n> I don’t think this is the right factoring though. The callback is called once per tab; OT1H that is nice for keeping the callback focused on rendering and keeping control over the overall control flow. OTOH if the callback was passed the whole tabs list, there would be no need to pass it the ordinal number either (it would just be the list index of a tab), and it could potentially control the overall set of tabs, to do things like hide certain tabs entirely.\r\n\r\nI see your point here but if we pass a list of tab data to the rendering function, what is it supposed to return? A list of formatted strings? Certainly returning a fully-formatted single string is not going to work, because then the plugin has no concept of where tabs are and would not know how to space or clip them. As far as hiding tabs goes, the current PR allows for that (I think - haven't actually tested) by returning an empty string.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is passing a list of tabs to the rendering function may make sense for the default rendering function that lives in the plugin, but becomes problematic for user-defined rendering functions. I think from a simplicity perspective, having the render function take a dictionary of data about a single tab and return a formatted string as the label for that tab is the most intuitive behavior. Given this is meant to be user-configurable, I think keeping the interface as simple as possible is desirable, even if it might be marginally slower. (But then again, anyone configuring this will have to know a fair amount of Vimscript, so maybe weighing simplicity so heavily is misguided on my part.)\r\n\r\n> Related to that – it seems to me, though I’ve not confirmed it, that you’ve created a bug, in that the code which clips tabs at the ends of the screen will cut characters from the `%#BufTabLineFoo%` highlighting escape instead of going into the label.\r\n\r\nI am sure you are correct - this is not something I considered. I have an idea how to work around this, but it would be a huge mess, so I will probably just move the highlighting back into the plugin. I tacked on the highlighting stuff right at the end, hoping to close a couple of the open issues with that feature, but as you point out, it's very problematic to the say least.\r\n\r\n> Maybe arbitrary highlighting needs to be punted to v2 of the API…\r\n\r\nI think this is probably the best idea. Let's limit this round to providing users the ability to customize the \"shape\" of the tab - i.e. the contents of the string itself - and worry about arbitrary highlighting later (or never).\r\n\r\n> If you want to keep working on this, do you want to do update #54 or close it and create a new PR?\r\n\r\nEither is fine with me - I don't mind amending commits. If you have a preference just let me know."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T22:12:27Z"},{"id":"7312771227","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":15123254,"login":"DarkTexas","display_login":"DarkTexas","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15123254?"},"repo":{"id":28675035,"name":"ircd-hybrid/hopm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm"},"payload":{"action":"opened","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm/issues/25","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm/issues/25/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm/issues/25/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ircd-hybrid/hopm/issues/25/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ircd-hybrid/hopm/issues/25","id":301202005,"number":25,"title":"not banning?","user":{"login":"DarkTexas","id":15123254,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15123254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas","html_url":"https://github.com/DarkTexas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarkTexas/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-02-28T22:07:31Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T22:07:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hey, I didn't know where else I could contact you guys, didn't find anyone on #ircd-coders!\r\n\r\nHOPM is running and somy proxys are giving bits back once scanned; but HOPM doesn't ban them, is there a way you assist me?
