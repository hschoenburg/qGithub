This will allow clients like dashboard to start doing SSE, as well as our own CLI.\r\n\r\nOne of the important benefits from an end user with this change, will be reconnects, and having the protocol just do the work for us (namely, sending `last-event-id` during reconnects).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Adds the `eventsource` package to `package.json`\r\n- Uses `new EventSource` in `readLogs`\r\n- the Promise will only reject if we get a `404` or a `403`. Contract wise, that's really the only reason we should fully abort the stream.\r\n- If the URL isn't a tail session, then we abort on first `err`.\r\n   Unclear to me if we can pass the `tail=true` from somewhere, so I went with just parsing the URL to make it self contained. Open to suggestions though!\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n- Feb 16: Added `User-Agent` header in `EventSource` constructor. Allows us to set `HEROKU_DEBUG_USER_AGENT=direwolf` in direwolf and do some segmentation in terms of metrics.\r\n- Feb 16: Brought back the old readLogs (calling it `readLogsV1`) to and we use it when we have the old form of the URL. The goal is to sunset this when we're GA.\r\n- Changed the error message when stream times out to `Log stream timed out.

having a problem or would like to suggest a feature.\r\n\r\nMy current problem is 'bundle install fails with rubygems 2.7.5 (ruby 2.3.6) on ubuntu 16.04'\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to:\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Network problems\r\n  - [ ] Installing a library\r\n  - [ ] Publishing a library\r\n  - [ ] The command line `gem`\r\n  - [x] Other\r\n\r\nHere are my current environment details:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem env version\r\n2.7.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n\r\nWhen deploying to an Opsworks instance in AWS (Ubuntu 16.04) our chef cookbook updated rubygems from 2.7.4 to 2.7.5.  After making this change bundler started returning this error...\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/bin/bundle:23:in `load': cannot load such file -- /usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.1/exe/bundle (LoadError)\r\n\tfrom /usr/local/bin/bundle:23:in `<main>'\r\n```\r\nUpgrading rubygems installed bundler in `/var/lib/gems/2.3.0/gems`, but the wrapper script seems to expect to find it in `/usr/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.16.1/exe/`\r\n\r\nDowngrading to rubygems 2.7.4 via `gem update --system 2.7.4` seems to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nNote:  Ruby was installed using the ruby-ng cookbook (https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ruby-ng), which installs the brightbox-ng ruby package for 2.3.6.  (see https://launchpad.net/~brightbox/+archive/ubuntu/ruby-ng)."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rubygems/rubygems/issues/comments/369423426","html_url":"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/2180#issuecomment-369423426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rubygems/rubygems/issues/2180","id":369423426,"user":{"login":"sj26","id":14028,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26","html_url":"https://github.com/sj26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sj26/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T23:45:19Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T23:45:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Here's
