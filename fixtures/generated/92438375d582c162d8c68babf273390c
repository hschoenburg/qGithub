Summary\r\n\r\n-   What does this package do? (explain in 50 words or less):\r\n    -   Provides neutral landscape models and utility functions to work with and extend them. NLMR uses raster as its geospatial framework and can therefore easily be used in landscape analysis to test against the influence of landscape patterns and serve as a basis for spatial simulation modeling.\r\n\r\n-   Paste the full DESCRIPTION file inside a code block below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage: NLMR\r\nType: Package\r\nTitle: Simulating Neutral Landscape Models\r\nVersion: 0.2\r\nAuthors@R: c(person(\"Marco\", \"Sciaini\", email = \"sciaini.marco@gmail.com\", role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")), \r\n    person(\"Matthias\", \"Fritsch\", email = \"matthias.fritsch@forst.uni-goettingen.de\", role =  c(\"aut\")),\r\n    person(\"Craig\", \"Simpkins\", email = \"simpkinscraig063@gmail.com\", role =  c(\"aut\")),\r\n    person(\"Cédric\", \"Scherer\", email = \"cedricphilippscherer@gmail.com\", role =  c(\"ctb\"), comment = \"Implemented nlm_neigh\"))\r\nDescription: Provides neutral landscape models \r\n    (Gardner et al. 1987 <doi:10.1007/BF02275262>,\r\n    With 1997 <doi:10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96210.x>) that can easily extend in \r\n    existing landscape analyses. Neutral landscape models range from \"hard\" \r\n    neutral models (completely random distibuted), to \"soft\" neutral models (definable spatial characteristics) and \r\n    generate landscape patterns that are independent of ecological processes.\r\n    Thus, these patterns can be used as null models in landscape ecology. 'NLMR' \r\n    combines a large number of algorithms from other published software for simulating neutral landscapes (Saura & \r\n    Martínez 2000   <doi:10.1023/A:1008107902848>, Etherington et\r\n    al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12308>) and\r\n    includes utility functions to classify and combine the multiple landscapes. The \r\n    simulation results are obtained in a geospatial data format (raster* objects \r\n    from the 'raster' package) and can, therefore, be used \r\n    in any sort of raster data operation that is performed with standard \r\n    observation data.                                                                                                  \r\nLicense: GPL-3\r\nCopyright: file inst/COPYRIGHTS\r\nEncoding: UTF-8\r\nLazyData: true\r\nByteCompile: true\r\nDepends:\r\n    R (>= 3.1.0)\r\nRoxygenNote: 6.0.1\r\nImports:\r\n    checkmate,\r\n    dismo,\r\n    dplyr,\r\n    ggplot2,\r\n    igraph,\r\n    magrittr,\r\n    purrr,\r\n    RandomFields,\r\n    raster,\r\n    rasterVis,\r\n    sp,\r\n    spatstat,\r\n    stats,\r\n    tibble,\r\n    viridis,\r\n    extrafont\r\nURL: https://marcosci.github.io/NLMR/\r\nBugReports: https://github.com/marcosci/NLMR/issues/\r\nSuggests:\r\n    testthat,\r\n    covr,\r\n    knitr,\r\n    rmarkdown,\r\n    lintr\r\nVignetteBuilder:\r\n    knitr\r\n```\r\n\r\n-   URL for the package (the development repository, not a stylized html page):\r\n    - [https://github.com/marcosci/NLMR](https://github.com/marcosci/NLMR)\r\n\r\n- Please indicate which category or categories from our [package fit policies](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/policies.md#package-fit) this package falls under ***and why**(? (e.g., data retrieval, reproducibility. If you are unsure, we suggest you make a pre-submission inquiry.):\r\n\r\n    - ***geospatial data***, because the package simulates land use patterns in a geospatial format.\r\n    - ***Exploratory data analysis***, because the package can be used as a very fundamental null hypothesis in any analysis that formulate questions around the influence of landscape pattern on processes (e.g. ecological, social processes), \r\n\r\n-   Who is the target audience and what are scientific applications of this package?  \r\n    - ***Target audience***: Mainly ecologists, since neutral landscape models are a well-established method in their field. But the package itself can be used by a broad audience, as it is convenient way to quickly prototype spatial simulation models.\r\n    - ***Scientific applications***: Formulating null hypotheses in a landscape analysis, test and develop landscape metrics, gradient analysis of the influence of landscape patterns on ecological processes, starting point for spatial simulations, such as agent-based models. \r\n\r\n-   Are there other R packages that accomplish the same thing? If so, how does\r\nyours differ or meet [our criteria for best-in-category](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/policies.md#overlap)?\r\n    - There was ecomodtools, which could simulate a small fraction of the neutral landscape models in NLMR. But it is not under active development anymore and does not compile under newer R versions. \r\n\r\n-   If you made a pre-submission enquiry, please paste the link to the corresponding issue, forum post, or other discussion, or @tag the editor you contacted.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nConfirm each of the following by checking the box.
