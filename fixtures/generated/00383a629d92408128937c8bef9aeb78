started working on moving the design library for [DeclareDesign] from vignettes in the main package to being their own package.  Vignettes as source-of-truth has been a failure for this project - it seems like code should just be functions.\r\n\r\nOne of my main motivations for transitioning is that the shiny applet we've built needs to be able to load the stock designs in a standardized way, and checking in RDS binaries led to much confusion as they drifted from the actual code (as written in the vignette).   \r\n\r\nNow that the template functions are their own functions in the [DDlib] package, using them is as simple as loading the package.\r\n\r\nOne wrinkle is that we want to execute the code of the functions in the vignette, but not by calling the function, but as if we had copy-pasted the body into the function itself. [knitr] has a hook for providing it source:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ```{r my_chunk, code=\"print('HIARYLAH')\"}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nwill evaluate the text in the `code=` option as if it were in the chunk. Since this can be any expression, we just need write a helper function that returns the function body as text.\r\n\r\n### Version 1\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at extracting source from a template function: \r\n\r\n```r\r\ntemplate_text <- function(template){\r\n  deparse(body(template))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\nThis worked OK, but had a couple draw backs:\r\n  * weird line wrapping - had to be constant\r\n  * comments are stripped out, as it's reading from the AST of the function\r\n\r\n### Version 2\r\n\r\n```r\r\ntemplate_text <- function(template) {\r\n  as.character(getSrcref(template))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out that R actually save a copy of source code of each function, so that when you print it the comments remain. It does so by adding a `srcref` attribute to each function in a package which references which files/lines the function was defined at. \r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\nSo theoretically, the below should inline the function body into our document and evaluate it:\r\n\r\n    ```{r my_chunk, code=template_text(my_template_func)}\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis works - but only when clicking the \"Knit\" button or running `R CMD Sweave`. Unfortunately, it won't work in `R CMD build` - it seems like `srcref` is just not available in that code path.\r\n\r\nAfter a little digging, I found the following [options] control the  `srcref` features:\r\n\r\n> keep.source:\r\n> When TRUE, the source code for functions (newly defined or loaded) is stored internally allowing comments to be kept in the right places. Retrieve the source by printing or using deparse(fn, control = \"useSource\").\r\n> \r\n> The default is interactive(), i.e., TRUE for interactive use.\r\n> \r\n> keep.source.pkgs:\r\n> As for keep.source, used only when packages are installed. Defaults to FALSE unless the environment variable R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE is set to yes.\r\n\r\nViola! Just `R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE=yes`. Obviously.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnfultz@neal-ddiMac:DDlib$R_KEEP_PKG_SOURCE=yes R CMD build .\r\n* checking for file './DESCRIPTION' ...
