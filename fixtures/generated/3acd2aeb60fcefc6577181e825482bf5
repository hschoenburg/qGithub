signature-hash algorithm pairs that are within the range of valid values but are unknown or unsupported. Send an alert for all other (invalid) values. \r\n\r\n**Issue # (if available):** N/A\r\n\r\n**Description of changes:** \r\n\r\nWe currently ignore unknown, unsupported, and invalid values. If we receive any of these in the signature_algorithms extension or CertificateRequest, we just ignore them and fall back to using the default signature-hash algorithm combination. This is partially because we set s2n_errno but do not check it. The concern was that someone could add a GUARD around the call to `s2n_sig_hash_algs_pairs_set` which would change this behavior and start failing the handshake.  \r\n\r\nThis change only sets s2n_errno for invalid values, and skips unknown or unsupported valid values. It also ensures that we fail the handshake if s2n_errno is set.\r\n\r\n@raycoll has a unit test that he will submit to verify this behavior.\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my

https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/pull/3402 we implemented order status as a function of the authorizations associated with an order, and their respective statuses.\r\n\r\nThe [`sa.StatusForOrder` function](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/8cf8c44919d635e1bc8f5a5240aac3e08a748d84/sa/sa.go#L1666) relies on `sa.getAllOrderAuthorizations` to load the full authorizations for an order: \r\nhttps://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/8cf8c44919d635e1bc8f5a5240aac3e08a748d84/sa/sa.go#L1673 \r\n\r\n`statusForOrder` enforces the invariant that the # of authorization IDs in the order object (populated based on the `orderToAuthz` join table) should always be equal to the # of authorization objects returned by `sa.getAllOrderAuthorizations` an [`InternalServerError` is produced](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/8cf8c44919d635e1bc8f5a5240aac3e08a748d84/sa/sa.go#L1679:L1687).\r\n\r\nWe overlooked the fact that `sa.getAllOrderAuthorizations` has a `WHERE` clause that excludes expired authorizations: \r\nhttps://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/blob/8cf8c44919d635e1bc8f5a5240aac3e08a748d84/sa/sa.go#L1777\r\n\r\nTherefore, if an `order` has an authorization that expires, the authorization ID will remain in the `orderToAuthz` join table used to find the order's authorization IDs, but it will *not* be present in the results returned from `sa.getAllOrderAuthorizations`, which results in `sa.statusForOrder` producing an internal server error, which results in `sa.GetOrder` failing, which in turn makes almost all ACME v2 operations fail because they rely on fetching order details and status through `sa.GetOrder`.\r\n\r\nWorse, since our order expiry is currently set distinctly from authorization expiry (See https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/3498) order reuse will return the broken order for subsequent `newOrder` requests for the same identifiers.\r\n\r\nTo fix, `sa.getAllOrderAuthorizations` should return expired authorizations. In `sa.StatusForOrder` we should mark the order's overall status as `invalid` when one or more authorizations are expired."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T16:38:11Z","org":{"id":9289019,"login":"letsencrypt","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/letsencrypt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9289019?"}},{"id":"7311046337","type":"PushEvent","actor":{"id":220205,"login":"jsha","display_login":"jsha","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsha","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220205?"},"repo":{"id":28283593,"name":"letsencrypt/boulder","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/letsencrypt/boulder"},"payload":{"push_id":2365917847,"size":4,"distinct_size":1,"ref":"refs/heads/certbot-master","head":"56c509eee4429388d9eb1d81ac849a8491ff47a2","before":"919f12a9dd87fd18ea58ff6cf2cb871aa7205348","commits":[{"sha":"b99907d4a97866239ddb13ab28b2e2db90e036d7","author":{"email":"daniel@binaryparadox.net","name":"Daniel McCarney"},"message":"ACMEv2 support for load-generator.
