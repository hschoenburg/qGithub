PR adds a backwards-compatible way to create certificates for multiple domain names.\r\n\r\nThe domain names are requested using the `set_requested_certificates` method, and a `live_all` method to get all generated certificates. The config value and `live` still work exactly the same. Using both config value and `set_requested_certificates` at the same time is even supported.\r\n\r\nExample of a layer using this functionality to create a https reverseproxy:

Instead of blocking though, I've introduced futures, which will integrate nicely with Tokio for concurrency & networking.\r\n* Abstracted out the storage into a Store trait, replaced the vec implementation with BTreeSet to improve matching performance; as in database LIKE wildcard queries, prefixes will tend to full scan, but in general performance should be better. This required some changes to the tuple and element types, esp around how comparisons and equality work. The Store trait could be implemented with a database backend, so there are improvements that can be made here..\r\n* Removed tuple expiration times and randomization of query results -- for now. I think these are really good ideas but they should probably be expressed by implementing the Store trait, perhaps extending it to allow policy directives. I'm thinking about how to support that in such a way that's open to extension.\r\n* Some syntactical sugar (macros, helper functions, etc.). More tests.\r\n\r\nI do apologize for the unwarranted rewrite of a good deal of things, and the amount of changes in this pull request. I've been wanting to write some code all week, and it was good getting back into Rust.. :) Let's call this a conversation starter -- feel free to land this of course, but also feel free to give me feedback and let me know what you'd like to see done differently.\r\n\r\nNetworking is next on my list... I'd like to put a simple interactive CLI frontend that supports Linda primitives, served up over SSH or websockets. Also want to try coordinating Actix actors with this stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","created_at":"2018-02-19T04:54:10Z","updated_at":"2018-02-19T04:54:10Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Micutio/rustupolis/pulls/1/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Micutio/rustupolis/pulls/1/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Micutio/rustupolis/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Micutio/rustupolis/issues/1/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Micutio/rustupolis/statuses/5d78b0fbd95e2148f46ce26df56a8c7dc81e5456","head":{"label":"cmars:master","ref":"master","sha":"5d78b0fbd95e2148f46ce26df56a8c7dc81e5456","user":{"login":"cmars","id":23741,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/23741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars","html_url":"https://github.com/cmars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121788128,"name":"rustupolis","full_name":"cmars/rustupolis","owner":{"login":"cmars","id":23741,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/23741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars","html_url":"https://github.com/cmars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/cmars/rustupolis","description":"rustupolis
