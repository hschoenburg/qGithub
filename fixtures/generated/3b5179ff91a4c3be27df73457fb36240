PR extends the root helper to be able to start and stop the KBFS redirector.  In particular:\r\n* It adds 2 new RPCs, \"startRedirector\" and \"stopRedirector\".\r\n* The start RPC takes a path to a binary, rather than hardcoding a path, to let us be flexible with application paths in the future without needing to update the helper.  However, we obviously don't want the helper to be able to execute arbitrary binaries.  So we copy the binary to a root-only temp dir and check its codesign signature before executing it.\r\n* The redirector is executed as a simple NSTask, rather than using launchd as root.  A future PR will ensure it's always started on reboots.\r\n* Right now the redirector mounts to `/keybase.redirect`.  A future PR will move the per-user mountpoints to `~/keybase` (or possible somewhere not in the home directory, depending on what we decide), and then will rename the redirector mount to `/keybase`.\r\n\r\nThis is being merged into the root-redirector branch, not to master.\r\n\r\nIssue:

handling of hitting \"cancel\" when asked for helper password (uninstalls fuse in that case).\r\n\r\nOf course, instead of making a symlink from `/keybase`, this new code just mounts the redirector there.\r\n\r\nI think the only interesting thing to review here is the dialog text, which may change slightly if we decide to move the mount out of the home directory.\r\n\r\nIssue:
