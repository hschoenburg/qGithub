Oddly, none of these are in the Cache folder, as I'd expect. And some of these are nearly a year old (not modified since April of 2017).\r\n\r\nSuggested improvements:\r\n\r\n1. Image previews should be stored in a sub-folder.\r\n2. Periodically, images not modified or accessed in over NN days should be purged.\r\n3. Image previews that could not be successfully downloaded should not leave a zero-byte file behind.\r\n4. Please settle on a consistant naming scheme for previews and stick with it, :)\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit hesitant about the idea of caching images from Keybase chat in a completely unencrypted form on the local filesystem. I'd hope that they'd be encrypted or only kept in memory.\r\n\r\nObviously, like any digital medium, Keybase can be used for criminal endeavors. I don't know what the proper ethical stance should be on if, say, a pedophile using Keybase has images of child porn cached. Is the product complicit if the end-user is busted for posession of child porn, because he/she thought Keybase secured them? That's probably a solution for your lawyers and license statements.\r\n\r\nI personally think it'd be best to move the image preview storage to a secure medium or soley keep it in RAM. Or hey, maybe the caching of images should be in the user's KBFS. I like that idea.\r\n\r\nHTH.
