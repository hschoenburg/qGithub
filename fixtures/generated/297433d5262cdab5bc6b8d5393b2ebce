believe Diaspora should allow users to upload videos and create video posts, just as they can post images onto the network. Most modern social media platforms allow users to publish video clips in addition to images, and from the perspective of an user I consider this a needed feature for Diaspora to be a complete solution.\r\n\r\nNote: I'm aware that users can already embed Youtube as well as Vimeo videos. This is completely unrelated to that functionality, and addresses being able to attach videos in posts.\r\n\r\nThere are a few obstacles to this feature. One is the drive storage and network bandwidth required to stream video... this can be fixed by making video support customizable, allowing pod administrators to disable it altogether or set file size limits per video file. Another concern may relate to supported formats... the pod would have to process uploaded videos into a common one (avi, mp4, ogv) as well as generating a video thumbnail in the process, then offer a HTML5 video player that allows watching the video in its post of origin."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diaspora/diaspora/issues/comments/369418306","html_url":"https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/7361#issuecomment-369418306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/diaspora/diaspora/issues/7361","id":369418306,"user":{"login":"ennder","id":134126,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/134126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder","html_url":"https://github.com/ennder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ennder/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T23:19:33Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T23:19:33Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T23:19:33Z","org":{"id":293207,"login":"diaspora","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/diaspora","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293207?"}},{"id":"7312964318","type":"WatchEvent","actor":{"id":17228477,"login":"Hum4n01d","display_login":"Hum4n01d","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hum4n01d","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17228477?"},"repo":{"id":75543530,"name":"duffn/dumb-password-rules","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/duffn/dumb-password-rules"},"payload":{"action":"started"},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-28T22:50:20Z"},{"id":"7312874262","type":"PullRequestReviewCommentEvent","actor":{"id":1317309,"login":"HeartSaVioR","display_login":"HeartSaVioR","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?"},"repo":{"id":14135470,"name":"apache/storm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm"},"payload":{"action":"created","comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/storm/pulls/comments/171405779","pull_request_review_id":100253489,"id":171405779,"diff_hunk":"@@

I work with Jupyter notebook in Firefox (updated Anaconda installation; Ubuntu). Since about two weeks, I keep getting logged out automatically (I don't know if I use the correct term here). What happens is that the automatic save feature will fail (the \"Forbidden\" sign pops up on the notebook upper right corner) and I cannot save \"manually\" as well. When I attempt to go the dashboard I get prompted to provide the session token. \r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that this issue happens randomly during a session. It may appear after hours from starting Jupyter/firefox or even right from the start. Also, when I do provide the token, it often happens that I keep getting logged out right the next second and have to do several attempts till I can have it working. \r\n\r\nThis issue does not happen when I work on a different browser (chromium).\r\n\r\nP.S.: I see similar reports for Firefox

want to make the result of some JavaScript (`document.URL`) accessible from Python code. My code uses a `FrontendComm` and `IPython.display.display(IPython.display.JavaScript(...))` to execute the JavaScript. A callback is called when the URL arrives. This mostly works, i. e. I get the URL and see it in the callback.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a problem if I try to make this call kind of synchronous. Now the callback saves the URL in an instance attribute and sets a `threading.Event`. (I just use the event instance for communication; I _don't_ start any threads.) A method, say `get`, then waits for the event, retrieves the value from the instance attribute and returns it. Something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Set a callback method to fire when the result of the JavaScript is available\r\n# and (presumably) execute the JavaScript. The callback will save the retrieved\r\n# URL in an instance attribute of `document_url`.\r\ndocument_url = DocumentURL()\r\n\r\n# Wait for the event to be set, then get the instance variable that was set above\r\n# and return it.\r\nurl = document_url.get()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works most of the time if the first and the second statement are in different cells. However, if I put both in the same cell, I get a deadlock. It seems that `IPython.display.display` \"displays\" the JavaScript only after the cell has run, but it never gets the chance because I wait for the result of the JavaScript execution in the very same cell. And because I'm waiting, the cell execution doesn't finish and the JavaScript is never executed. Hence the deadlock.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I also sometimes see a deadlock, even if the statements are in different cells, if the cells are executed quickly after another. For example, this happens when pressing shift-enter quickly several times or selecting the menu option to restart the kernel and run all cells.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get JavaScript executed immediately from Python code in a cell, that is, _before the cell execution is finished_? This would be conceptually like a hypothetical `flush=True` argument in `IPython.display.display`. I searched a good while for an answer on the web, including the tickets of `jupyter/notebook`, but didn't find anything helpful.\r\n  "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/notebook/issues/comments/369186699","html_url":"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3187#issuecomment-369186699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/notebook/issues/3187","id":369186699,"user":{"login":"takluyver","id":327925,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/327925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver","html_url":"https://github.com/takluyver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/takluyver/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T09:54:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T09:54:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I don't think there's a great way to do this.

\r\n\r\nMy issue is as follows. I work with Jupyter notebook in Firefox (updated Anaconda installation; Ubuntu). Since about two weeks, I keep getting logged out automatically (I don't know if I use the correct term here). What happens is that the automatic save feature will fail (the \"Forbidden\" sign pops up on the notebook upper right corner) and I cannot save \"manually\" as well. When I attempt to go the dashboard I get prompted to provide the session token. \r\n\r\nThe weird thing is that this issue happens randomly during a session. It may appear after hours from starting Jupyter/firefox or even right from the start. Also, when I do provide the token, it often happens that I keep getting logged out right the next second and have to do several attempts till I can have it working. \r\n\r\nThis issue does not happen when I work on a different browser (chromium).\r\n\r\nP.S.: I see similar reports for Firefox [here](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2396)"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/notebook/issues/comments/368999631","html_url":"https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3365#issuecomment-368999631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jupyter/notebook/issues/3365","id":368999631,"user":{"login":"BobbyTables42","id":20374891,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/20374891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42","html_url":"https://github.com/BobbyTables42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobbyTables42/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-27T19:36:51Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T19:36:51Z","author_association":"NONE","body":">  #3380 fixes the example I could reproduce - could you try that?
