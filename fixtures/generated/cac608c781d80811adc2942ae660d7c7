I think it makes sense to give them a way to turn it off if they don't want it.\r\n\r\nSince the root redirector runs as root, we can't just use a config value in the normal user-based config.json, since there might be multiple users on the machine all using keybase.  So the idea here is to allow the user to optionally create a file at `/etc/keybase/config.json` as root, and populate it thusly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"disable-root-redirector\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, we'll post instructions in the docs on how to stop the root redirector and delete `/keybase`, and when things get restarted, we won't try to start it up again.\r\n\r\nTo make that happen, this PR:\r\n* Adds new flags to `keybase config get` for:\r\n  * \"d, direct\": read a value directly from the config file, rather than relying on the Keybase service (and without launching a service, if one isn't already running).\r\n  * \"b, bare\": read a string from the config file without putting quotes around it.  (Not really needed for this PR, but helpful to avoid some sed-hacking in the scripts.)\r\n* Check the root config file in `run_keybase` and the Linux post-installer, and not starting the redirector if needed.\r\n* Check the root config file in OSX before starting the redirector.\r\n\r\ncc: @maxtaco for the `keybase config get` changes.\r\n\r\nIssue:

that's the idea.  We want to be able to \"shred\" the secret even on SSDs, which of course make it hard due to FTLs.

It still may be doable, but slightly harder than the naive
