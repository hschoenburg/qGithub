Before you post your suggestions, could you please certify that the service in which you're posting for suggestion is **currently** able to post or display permanently public information on your behalf where _anyone_ can view it without the need of a user account. Any information, such as a signed statement of authenticity which requires a user account severely limits the usage of Keybase. If these requirements are not met, then I will not add your suggestion to our community list. Additionally, please do not request specific communities; StackExchange, and user forums for example. Instead of suggesting `Wilders Security Forums` please suggest the forum software in which it is running, such as Xenforo.\r\n\r\nI've wanted to do this for a while now; but I think we should get a thread going for suggested verification so they can be referenced, and we can kind of get a road-map going here. I'll try to get @malgorithms and @maxtaco to verify or deny as to whether or not they're definite, or simply a possibility.\r\n\r\n**Please only using this thread for suggestions and not discussion.** If you have suggestions on how to process a suggested proof, please open a new issue so it can be discussed in depth.\r\n# Confirmed\r\n\r\n| Completed | Accepted |\r\n| :-- | :-- |\r\n| Github | Tumblr |\r\n| Twitter | Email |\r\n| HTTP/HTTPS | [Facebook](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/97#issuecomment-36684470) |\r\n| DNS |  |\r\n| Reddit |  |\r\n| HackerNews |  |\r\n| Coinbase |  |\r\n| Bitcoin |  |\r\n# Unconfirmed / Suggested\r\n\r\n| Suggestions | Pull Requests |\r\n| :-- | :-- |\r\n| Gitorious / ~~BitBucket~~ / ~~Google Code~~ | [BitBucket](https://github.com/keybase/proofs/pull/18) |\r\n| LiveJournal / Dreamwidth |  |\r\n| Jabber / XMPP |  |\r\n| StackExchange |  |\r\n| LinkedIn |  |\r\n| Threema |  |\r\n| TextSecure |  |\r\n| OpenIDs |  |\r\n| ~~App.net~~ |  |\r\n| Tox |  |\r\n| Google+ |  |\r\n| [ORCID](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/402) |  |\r\n| Medium |  |\r\n| Svbtle |  |\r\n| [Blogger](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518#issuecomment-147471786) |  |\r\n| WordPress |  |\r\n| Instagram |  |\r\n| Slack |  |\r\n| Flickr |  |\r\n| GnuSocial |  |\r\n| Pump.io |  |\r\n| Diaspora |  |\r\n| Namecoin |  |\r\n| Friendica |  |\r\n| HackerOne |  |\r\n| Etsy |  |\r\n| Circle (Bitcoin) |  |\r\n| Pinterest |  |\r\n| about.me |  |\r\n| Gravatar |  |\r\n| [Wikipedia/Wikimedia](704) |  |\r\n| Twister.net.co |  |\r\n| [BitTorrent Bleep](http://blog.bittorrent.com/2014/07/30/bittorrents-chat-client-unveiled-bittorrent-bleep-now-in-invite-only-pre-alpha/) |  |\r\n| SourceForge |  |\r\n| Pastebin |  |\r\n| geekli.st |  |\r\n| Slashdot |  |\r\n| [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/) |  |\r\n| [MiniLock.io](https://minilock.io/) |  |\r\n| [GreenAddress](https://greenaddress.it/en/) |  |\r\n| [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/) |  |\r\n| [Academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/) |  |\r\n| BitMessage |  |\r\n| Last.fm |  |\r\n| Steam |  |\r\n| lobste.rs |  |\r\n| linuxquestions.org |  |\r\n| [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/) |  |\r\n| [storj.io](http://storj.io/) |  |\r\n| Disqus |  |\r\n| [SlideShare](http://slideshare.net/) |  |\r\n| [Storj.io](http://storj.io/) |  |\r\n| Twitch.tv |  |\r\n| [WikiTree](http://www.wikitree.com/) |  |\r\n| [Geni](https://www.geni.com/) |  |\r\n| [RiseUp](https://we.riseup.net/) |  |\r\n| [I-Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-name) |  |\r\n| [.onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion) |  |\r\n| [.emc](https://emercoin.com/) |  |\r\n| [Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) |  |\r\n| [Proofile](http://proofile.org/) |  |\r\n| [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) |  |\r\n| [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/) |  |\r\n| [WOT](https://www.mywot.com/) |  |\r\n| HackaDay[Test Proof](https://hackaday.io/zQueal) |  |\r\n| Dribbble |  |\r\n| [Peercoin](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/1697) |  |\r\n| Ello |  |\r\n| OKCupid |  |\r\n| [Savannah](https://savannah.nongnu.org/) |  |\r\n| vBulletin |  |\r\n| phpbb |  |\r\n| [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) |  |\r\n| Telehack |  |\r\n|[Matrix.org](http://matrix.org/) / [Riot.im](https://riot.im/)||\r\n|[MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/)||\r\n|[Mastodon / GNUSocial](https://mastodon.social/about)||\r\n|Discord||\r\n\r\n# Denied\r\n| Suggestions |\r\n| :-- |\r\n| None |\r\n\r\nReply to this thread with a suggestion and if it's not already on the list, I'll add it.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/comments/369349287","html_url":"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518#issuecomment-369349287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/518","id":369349287,"user":{"login":"ahnick","id":710935,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/710935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick","html_url":"https://github.com/ahnick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahnick/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-28T19:11:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T19:11:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"What's the status on getting LinkedIn added?
