That was really unclear, unless you're me...\r\n\r\nPlease disregard this, as after checking ruby docs at https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en and https://ruby-doc.org, it appears I must be doing something specific to show these constants in Socket.\r\n\r\nAt some point, the [`Socket::Constants`](https://msp-greg.github.io/ruby_trunk/socket/Socket.html) module definition in trunk is no longer found by the parsing, which also causes the constants in `Socket` to disappear.  But, the last parsing of 2.5 they are shown [here](https://msp-greg.github.io/ruby_2_5/socket/Socket.html).\r\n\r\nI've got notes regarding this type of code in my doc system, but they're scattered, and I haven't needed to regularly update the code.  I need to get all the notes into one file, as I don't recall where the doc system is parsing the info for `Socket::Constants`...\r\n\r\nSo, I'm not sure what's causing it, so I'll check later.  My doc site is generated locally, and pushed to GitHub, while ruby-loco is totally in the cloud (but I run locally for testing).\r\n\r\nMaybe this make a bit more sense, and thanks, Greg\r\n\r\nAside: MJIT seems to consistently report\r\n```\r\n65 tests, 179 assertions, 8 failures, 0 errors, 5 skips\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf the 8, 7 are SEGV's..."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-22T16:56:41Z","org":{"id":210414,"login":"ruby","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/ruby","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/210414?"}},{"id":"7282368819","type":"WatchEvent","actor":{"id":25577944,"login":"donkov","display_login":"donkov","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/donkov","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25577944?"},"repo":{"id":538746,"name":"ruby/ruby","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby"},"payload":{"action":"started"},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-02-22T15:52:38Z","org":{"id":210414,"login":"ruby","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/ruby","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/210414?"}},{"id":"7282310852","type":"CommitCommentEvent","actor":{"id":3138447,"login":"k0kubun","display_login":"k0kubun","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3138447?"},"repo":{"id":538746,"name":"ruby/ruby","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby"},"payload":{"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/ruby/comments/27722549","html_url":"https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/cc777d09f44fa909a336ba14f3aa802ffe16e010#commitcomment-27722549","id":27722549,"user":{"login":"k0kubun","id":3138447,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/3138447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun","html_url":"https://github.com/k0kubun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/k0kubun/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"position":null,"line":null,"path":null,"commit_id":"cc777d09f44fa909a336ba14f3aa802ffe16e010","created_at":"2018-02-22T15:43:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T15:43:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"> I've got a doc web site at https://msp-greg.github.io/, and I often update it along with the ruby-loco test results. \r\n\r\nIt has so many items and I couldn't find which has the result in it :)\r\n\r\n> Today's run just had the following shown in the log, which I haven't seen previously.
